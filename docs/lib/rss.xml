<br>Start phase

<br>Calculate turn order for this round


<br>Action phase

<br>Players and NPCs take their turns in order, choosing and executing one of the following ordered groups:

<br>Move -&gt; Action and Rapid Action
<br>Action and Rapid Action -&gt; Move
<br>Move -&gt; Action and Prepared Action
<br>Action and Prepared Action -&gt; Move
<br>Move -&gt; Move (Running)
<br>Full-turn Action




<br>End phase

<br>Death, leaving combat and fleeing
<br>Conversing, discussing, bargaining




<br>End of round

<br>Return to round start if necessary.


<br><br>A battle map is a grid of squares overlaid on top of a map, a sketch or a similar image depicting a location that the combat takes place in. Each square in a battle map is considered to be a 1 square meter area. Creatures can be represented with tokens or similar objects on this battle map.<br><br>Combat has rules for resolving various situations that players and the GM might come across. These can be found <a data-href="List of Rules - Combat" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-rules-combat.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">List of Rules - Combat</a>.<br><br>At the start phase of every round, turn order will be calculated for this round. There are several rules:<br>
<br>Every creature in combat is ordered in terms of their SPD from highest to lowest.
<br>Allies with same SPD value must determine who goes first beforehand. This can only be changed in the end phase during combat.
<br>If there are creatures with equal SPD in at least any two sides in the combat, the following rules are applied:

<br>The conflicting sides roll a d20 each.
<br>For conflicting turn order spots, higher rolling teams' members will go earlier than the lower rolling teams' members with the same SPD.
<br>If there is a draw, another set of d20s must be rolled between the drawing sides.


<br>A creature can only have one turn within one round, even if the creature is next in initiative order.<br><br>
<br>Effects of abilities with a duration of one or more "hits" trigger and end during the recipient's turns: 

<br>If a creature is bleeding for one hit, they will take bleeding damage at the start of their next turn and the bleeding ends. 
<br>If the bleeding has a duration of two or more hits, then one hit will be spent when the bleeding damage happens.


<br>Effects of abilities with a duration of one or more "rounds" end at the start of the turns of their owners.
<br><br>Each turn takes approximately 10 seconds in game.<br><br>These are regular actions. Mostly, only one action can be taken during a turn.<br><br>During a turn, one rapid action can be taken alongside a regular action.<br>
A rapid action is mutually exclusive with a prepared action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn.<br><br>During a turn, one prepared action can be taken alongside a regular action.<br>
This kind of actions always come with a trigger, and they are usually performed outside a character's turn.<br>
Prepared actions last until end of this round, unless explicitly told otherwise.<br>
A prepared action is mutually exclusive with a rapid action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn.<br><br>These actions can be taken by any player character as long as they fulfill the requirements. See <a data-href="List of Rules - Special Actions" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-rules-special-actions.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">List of Rules - Special Actions</a>.<br><br>Precision rolls determine whether a weapon attack, a spell, a combat technique or any other ability succeeds against an unwilling target.<br>A precision roll is done against a resistance, such as Parry or Evasion. If the result of this roll exceeds or is equal to the resistance it is rolled against, the roll succeeds and the spell or attack connects. <br>Additionally, if you roll a 10 with a precision roll's d10, the roll succeeds regardless of the relevant resistance. <br><br>A precision roll is calculated according to this formula:<br>
1d10 + (relevant aptitude)/2 + weapon precision bonus + other bonuses<br>Terms in this formula are explained below:<br>
Relevant aptitude: Equal to half of the weapon's or the spell's aptitude. For example, an elemental wand uses witchcraft. Bonuses to your aptitudes do not affect your precision rolls.<br>
Weapon precision bonus: A weapon's precision type and bonus is determined by the type of the weapon held in main hand or the wielded two-handed weapon.<br>
Other bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.<br>In some cases, a specific spell, an ability or an attack might include a precision bonus or penalty itself. For example, "wide slash" attack of a glaive doesn't include "weapon precision bonus" in its precision roll. We know this because "wide slash" has the phrase "ignores weapon precision" in its explanation. A weapon precision bonus only applies when a precision roll matches the weapon's precision type. For example, a wand of any type normally doesn't affect precision rolls based on strength.<br><br>When a creature takes damage, this damage value reduces their health.<br><br>Damage done to a target is calculated according to this formula:<br>
Action damage + potency of relevant aptitude + other bonuses - target's armor<br>Terms in this formula are explained below:<br>
Action damage: Action damage is the damage of an attack or a damaging spell. This value is given for each weapon and spell in the description of it.<br>
Potency of relevant aptitude: Equal to the potency stat of the weapon's or the spell's aptitude. For example, a curved sword uses POW.<br>
Other bonuses:  These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.<br>
Target's armor: Armor is explained in the Armor section. <br>In some cases, a specific spell or attack might include a potency bonus or penalty itself. As an example, let's take the Witchcraft spell Elemental Infusion. This spell includes the phrase "potency bonus to damage is halved for this spell". This simply means "potency of relevant aptitude" is divided by two in the formula:<br>
Action damage + (potency of relevant aptitude)/2 + other bonuses - target's armor<br><br>Each creature has two kinds of armor: physical armor and magical armor. Normally, damage from weapon attacks and similar abilities are affected by physical armor and damage from magical sources like spells are affected by magical armor. If something is an exception to this rule, this is told in the explanation of it.<br><br>For a spell to be considered a "damaging ability", it should have a base damage. Examples could be abilities like "Dissonance", "Shield Bash" or the hatchet's "Hack". Some actions only apply a status effect, but do not have a base damage. These abilities are not considered damaging abilities.<br><br>Extra damage is a completely different packet of damage that just shares the precision roll of another attack. Extra damage has its own values for action damage, potency, bonuses and it is affected by armor separately from the delivering attack.<br>On the other hand, bonus damage is just added into the delivering attack's damage calculation. Specifically, into the "other bonuses" term.]]></description><link>sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:36:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Combat Techniques]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.<br>There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:<br>
<br>Be able to sit or lie down. 
<br>Be relaxed.
<br>Be in a safe environment.
<br>Sleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:<br>
<br>They have a place to sleep.
<br>They are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.
<br>Resting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:<br>
<br>Characters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping.
<br>Similarly, 2 points of energy regenerates per hour while sleeping.
<br>While only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.
<br>However, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.<br><br><a href=".?query=tag:TODO" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#TODO</a> ]]></description><link>sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sigil-of-uchma/Content/Player Characters.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 15:14:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Skills]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character. Each skill is about a certain set of actions or abilities. Skills are improved by spending skill points. At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll from a player. This can be because of something the player wants to do, an environmental effect or something else. While the GM can freely determine the success threshold, a list of sample success thresholds for common situations will be given. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: <br>
<br>1d10 + skill value + bonuses
<br>Furthermore, some skills are grouped under an aptitude. When a character makes a skill roll with a skill bound to an aptitude, the roll is instead:<br>
<br>1d10 + skill value + relevant aptitude + bonuses
<br>Players gain a set amount of Skill Points (SP) on each level up. SPs can be spent on a skill to increase its value by one. A skill can be increased only once per level. A total of 22 SP can be earned. Points gained per level are given in this table:<br><br><br>
<br>Engineering

<br>Crafting mechanisms and machinery.


<br>Smithing

<br>Creating and improving weapons and armor. Also includes fletching.

 <br><br>Normally, magic and magical power is found all around the world of Sigil of Uchma. Some can expand their inner energy out as structured magic. Shaping energy into a form to fulfill a purpose gives it different effects, and this shape can be remembered. Spell casters such as Magician learn and keep track of these forms.<br>Spells are, simply put, known shapes and forms of magic. Spells need to be trained like a soldier trains with a weapon, and casting one requires a similar amount of muscle memory to martial arts. A spell caster has a definite amount of energy in their body. Energy is gained passively while sleeping or resting.<br>Spells are split into three categories. Each of these can be found in their respective list:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="List of Spells - Witchcraft" data-href="List of Spells - Witchcraft" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-spells-witchcraft.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Witchcraft Spells</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="List of Spells - Divine" data-href="List of Spells - Divine" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-spells-divine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Divine Spells</a>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="List of Spells - Social" data-href="List of Spells - Social" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-spells-social.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Social Spells</a>
<br>Spells in each category are further divided into three groups: novice, veteran and expert. These three groups guide the spell learning progress. A similar mechanism exists on <a data-href="Combat Techniques" href="sigil-of-uchma/content/combat-techniques.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Combat Techniques</a>, albeit the names of the groups are different.<br>Lastly, a spell can be a complex spell or a simple spell. This mainly affects what kind of spells a character can learn. For example, the "magical specialization" ability of a Soldier only allows them to learn a simple novice spell. However, a Magician can learn both simple and complex witchcraft spells.]]></description><link>sigil-of-uchma/content/spells.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sigil-of-uchma/Content/Spells.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 06:40:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weapons]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Weapons are what creatures use to hit their foes. Most creatures with body parts similar to arms and hands can use every weapon. There are several categories of weapons. Each of these can be found in their respective list:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="List of Weapons - One Handed" data-href="List of Weapons - One Handed" href="sigil-of-uchma/lists/list-of-weapons-one-handed.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">One Handed weapons</a>

<br><br>Some abilities may include a phrase similar to "doing a basic weapon attack". This means using the regular attack of a weapon, which is almost always the first active ability. <br><br>Weapon sets are helpful guides used primarily during character creation. If you take a bow, you will also get a quiver and 30 basic arrows. <br>Regular weapon set<br>
<br>A one handed weapon and an off-hand weapon.
<br>A one handed weapon and a light one handed weapon.
<br>A two handed weapon. 
<br>Light weapon set<br>
<br>A light one handed weapon and an off-hand weapon.
<br>Two light one handed weapons.
<br>Ranged weapon set<br>
<br>A ranged weapon.
<br>At least two, up to five throwing spears. 
<br>Info
 If you choose throwing spear in any set, you can take up to five spears. Extra spears take up space and require a quiver. You can take throwing spears with the ranged weapon set only if you take multiple spears.

 <br>(see: <a data-href="Combat" href="sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Combat</a>)<br><br>(see: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Combat > Battle Map" data-href="Combat#Battle Map" href="sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Battle_Map" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Battle Maps</a>)<br>
During combat, a creature can move within the battle map grid. There are various types of moving, which are explained below.<br>Movement speed of a creature is equal to:<br>
(base movement speed + other bonuses) meters/round<br>Base movement speed of a creature is calculated with the formula below:<br>
(10 + SPD) meters/round<br><br>
<br>Walking is the simplest way of movement. a creature's walking speed is equal to its movement speed, normally.
<br><br>
<br>Instead of taking an action, a creature might "walk" twice. This is called "running" and unless specified otherwise, it is equal to double the walking speed.
<br>A running creature can't take actions, rapid actions, prepared actions or full-turn actions.
<br><br>
<br>If a creature can fly, their flight speed is equal to their walking speed. Flight speed can be used vertically or horizontally. However, ascending takes up 4 flight speed per meter ascended.
<br>A flying creature can't use its walking speed unless they land.
<br>If a creature is flying, they are unaffected by any effects on the ground, unless the effect is tall enough to reach it.
<br><br>
<br>There are two kinds of rough terrain: light and heavy.

<br>Walking or running through light rough terrain such as soft sand or shallow water takes up 2 walking speed per meter walked.
<br>Walking through heavy rough terrain such as quicksand takes up 4 walking speed per meter walked.
<br>Swimming in deep water, climbing and crawling are considered heavy rough terrain.


<br><br>
<br>When a player character falls below 0 health, they are considered "unconscious".
<br>An unconscious character is considered prone.
<br>If a player character takes equal to or more than double their base maximum health, they die immediately.
<br>At the end phase of each round, unconscious characters make a death save roll against increased thresholds:

<br>Death save rolls are calculated with this formula: (1d10 + VIT)
<br>1st round: 3
<br>2nd round: 5
<br>3rd round: 7
<br>4th round: 9


<br>A character dies if they fail any of their death saves or when they reach their 5th consecutive round in unconscious state. 
<br>If a character is healed to at least 1 health during unconscious state, they become conscious again and they are considered prone.
<br><br>
<br>Summoner can control their minions during combat. A minion disappears immediately when its summoner dies.
<br>Summoners have a simple telepathic bond to their minions. A summoner will know where a minion is and how much damage it suffered at all times. 
<br>The minions follow the regular initiative order. On a turn a minion is summoned, if they have higher initiative than their summoner, they take their turn immediately after the summoner.
<br>Minions gain potency bonus to their damage normally, according to their relevant potency stat.
<br>Minions don't use energy and energy for their skills, unless specified otherwise.
<br><br><a href=".?query=tag:TODO" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#TODO</a> <br><br>
<br>When a character is behind cover, they are semi-protected against projectile attacks or projectile spells.
<br>There are 3 types of cover:

<br>Quarter Cover: +1 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.
<br>Half Cover: +2 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.
<br>Full Cover: +4 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.


<br>Having other creatures in the way while determining cover counts as half cover. This doesn't increase with the amount of creatures in the way.
<br>If a creature is completely blocked from another's point of view, they are out of line of sight and can't be interacted with targeted attacks and spells.
<br>Abilities, spells and attacks which affect an area may require hearing or sight:

<br>Sounds can't pass rocks, deep water and similar materials.
<br>Sounds can pass 1 meter of wood, metal, shallow water and other similar materials.
<br>Cover of any kind doesn't break line of sight.
<br>Magical remote eyes and ears count as sight and hearing for the purposes of these kind of effects.
<br>There may be magical effects which can break line of sight or block sounds.


<br><br>
<br>During battle, whenever a creature has two or more adjacent melee combatants, they are considered flanked.
<br>Flanked creatures receive a -1 penalty to all resistances from precision rolls done by these melee combatants.
<br><br>
<br>A creature can go into prone voluntarily if they give up half of their base movement speed as a part of their movement during their turn.
<br>When a creature falls or goes prone, they have to be in movement phase of their turn and use half of their base movement speed to get up.
<br>A prone creature has half cover against projectiles.
<br>A prone creature has -2 to all resistances against attacks and spells used within melee range, including projectiles.
<br>A prone creature can only do their basic weapon attack, dealing half damage and ignoring weapon precision.
<br><br>

 <br><br>Sigil of Uchma (formerly TT Project) is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on a hypothetical medieval Central Asian society, based primarily on Gokturks and secondarily on other cultures within the area. The name is a reference to historical usage of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)" target="_blank">Nazar amulets</a>.<br>It is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their PCs, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and more.<br>Sigil of Uchma is an alternate history fantasy game. This means we are not bound strictly by Turkic mythology and lifestyle from early middle age and before. Things can be added, changed and removed. I highly recommend reading the resources in the section below.<br><br>
<br>Character creation guide: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Player Characters" data-href="Player Characters" href="sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Link</a>

<br><br>A base rule set to build and play different types of campaigns:<br>
Rules in this game are trimmed before they are added. This makes Sigil of Uchma a good base to build campaigns upon.<br>Uniquely themed items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:<br>
Sigil of Uchma has owl vampires, charming snake monsters able to transform into a human form, Central Asian spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.<br>Character creation full of meaningful choice:<br>
See <a data-href="Player Characters" href="sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Player Characters</a>.<br>Fun and engaging turn-based combat:<br>
Classes have both shared and unique abilities. Weapons have active and passive abilities, spells are varied and carry an impact while not being overpowered, armors are strong. Additionally there is no arbitrarily locking players out of features. A performer can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties to their spell casting.<br>Furthermore, there are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get very fast.<br>Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:<br>
Sigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Imagination in these situations can open up a lot of possibilities.<br><br>Currently, the game is in alpha state. This means it is not ready for running campaigns yet. When the first full version is released, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project/releases" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project/releases" target="_blank">it will be in the releases page of this repository</a>. <br>If you want to play the game anyway, I recommend sticking to one version and only updating if the newer version doesn't break the balance of the campaign.<br><br>There are not many resources on this topic.

           in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
           NonCommercial purposes only.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public

      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the

           Public License.

        b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
           Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
           automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
           under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

        c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
      provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Copy<br>  b. Other rights.<br>   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
      licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
      privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
      the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
      assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
      extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
      Rights, but not otherwise.

   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
      Public License.

   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
      collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
      Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
      under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
      licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
      reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
      the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
      purposes.

following conditions.<br>  a. Attribution.<br>   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
      form), You must:

           with the Licensed Material:

                Material and any others designated to receive

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
      reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in

      hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
      information.
   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
      information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent

 Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

      license with the same License Elements, this version or
      later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

   2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
      Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
      in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
      context in which You Share Adapted Material.

   3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
      or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
      Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
      rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
Copy<br>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.<br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that<br>
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br>  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right<br>
to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial<br>
portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes<br>
only;<br>  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database<br>
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database<br>
Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,<br>
including for purposes of Section 3(b); and<br>  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share<br>
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not<br>
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed<br>
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br>  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE<br>
EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS<br>
AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF<br>
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,<br>
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,<br>
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT<br>
KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT<br>
ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE<br>
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,<br>
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,<br>
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,<br>
COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR<br>
USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN<br>
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR<br>
DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR<br>
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided<br>
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent<br>
possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and<br>
waiver of all liability.<br>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.<br>  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and<br>
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with<br>
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License<br>
terminate automatically.<br>  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under<br>
Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br>   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
      it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
      violation; or

   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
Copy<br>  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the<br>
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop<br>
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so<br>
will not terminate this Public License.<br>  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public<br>
License.<br>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.<br>  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different<br>
terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.<br>  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the<br>
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and<br>
independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br>Section 8 -- Interpretation.<br>  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and<br>
shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose<br>
conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully<br>
be made without permission under this Public License.<br>  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is<br>
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the<br>
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision<br>
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License<br>
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and<br>
conditions.<br>  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no<br>
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the<br>
Licensor.<br>  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted<br>
