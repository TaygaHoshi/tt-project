This connection to the environment isn’t passive either: druids must constantly journey across the world, uncovering the countless ways these elements manifest. Earth can be fertile or barren; metal is hard but malleable to many shapes; fire scares animals but some tribes worship it; water sustains life but has the power to flood entire cities; and nature is both nurturing and merciless.A druid is always in harmony with the elements in their environment. When a druid spends more than an hour in an environment, they receive one of the following effects depending on where they are:\nEarth: Mountains, caves or underground. +1 bonus to Warding and Constitution.\nMetal: Settlements or large battlefields. (3 + P/3) bonus to physical damage, once per turn.\nFire: Deserts or volcanoes. (3 + P/3) bonus to magical damage, once per turn.\nWater: Sea, rivers, rainy or snowy places. +1 bonus to Parry and Evasion.\nNature: Woods, plains or forests. +1 bonus to precision rolls for druid techniques. Each place corresponds to exactly one element, and an effect gained from this ability lasts until the environment changes significantly.Category: Offense\nExecution Time: 5 minutes\nCost: 4 energy\nRadius: (20 + P) meters\nEffect\nThis ability does not require any precision roll, even against unwilling creatures.\nCreate a small earthquake centered around you, making every non-flying and unsuspecting creature within radius fall prone. Small structures and similar constructs within radius, depending on their strength, become destroyed or damaged.Category: Utility\nExecution Time: 1 hour\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (50 + 5 x P) meters\nDuration: (7 + C) days\nEffect\nYou spread your powers wide; improving, curing and growing nearby plants slightly. Plant creatures within radius gain 5 temporary physical armor for the duration. Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 4 energy\nRadius: (3 + P/2) meters\nDuration: (2 + C/2) hours\nEffect\nYou can vaguely guide the natural features of the geography around you to change shape. After half of this technique's duration has passed, the geography starts slowly returning to its original shape. While performing this technique, you can choose to spend double the energy cost instead. In this case, the technique requires 1 hour of uninterrupted casting but its effects stay permanent. Category: Offense\nExecution Time: Action\nCost: 2 energy\nRange: 5 meters\nDuration: (1 + C/2) hits\nEffect\n(Projectile)\nA powerful arc of lightning leaves your hand and strikes your target, dealing 5 magical damage and applying electrified for the duration.\nIf you fail the precision roll, the lightning hits the conductive object or soaked creature nearest you within your range and line of sight including yourself. In this case, it only applies 1 hit of electrified and deals no damage. Category: Defense\nExecution Time: Rapid action\nCost: 2 energy\nDuration: (1 + C/2) rounds\nEffect\nThis technique's precision roll is made against Evasion.\nSkin of a creature you can touch becomes enhanced with the metal element, gaining (5 + P/2) temporary physical armor. Alternatively, you can spend 4 energy and grant double the temporary armor. This creature is immobilized while this technique is active. When this temporary armor breaks, it rusts away and the technique ends. It can be dismissed by you freely.Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 4 energy\nRadius: 5 meters\nDuration: (2 + C/2) rounds\nEffect\nYou generate a large and stationary rain cloud above you, and it starts to rain immediately. Any creature who starts or ends their turn in the area below this cloud is soaked for one round unless it has cover from rain.\nAlternatively, you can choose to perform a wider and longer version of this technique. This requires 1 hour of uninterrupted casting. In this case, this rain cloud lasts for (2 + C/2) hours and affects a 50 meter radius area, which is considered a water environment for your element-enveloped ability.\nThis technique can only be used outside or interiors with sufficient space.Category: Offense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRange: 5 meters\nRadius: (1 + C/3) meters\nDuration: (1 + C/2) hits\nEffect\n(Projectile)\nThis technique's precision rolls are made against Evasion.\nThe ground turns into blazing embers within this technique's radius for 10 minutes.

It can shoot one needle per round, applying bleeding for 2 hits.\nThis plant inherits your aptitudes. It has 10 health, and its resistances are equal to your base resistances.\nA sprout created by this technique is immune to debilitating status effects.\nSprouts you create do not count towards your summon limit, and you can have up to (1 + P/2) sprouts at any time.Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Action\nCost: 4 energy\nRange: 5 meters\nRadius: 1 meter\nDuration: (2 + C/2) rounds\nEffect\nThis technique's precision rolls are made against Evasion.\nCreate an area of shifting, moving, waving and spiraling ground.

You receive a small object representing it in return, called a totem. You can recall your totem to yourself as an action. A totem can be partially or fully destroyed, making it lose its powers.

Combat has rules for resolving various situations that players and the GM might come across.A battle map is a grid of squares overlaid on top of a map, a sketch or a similar image depicting the location that the combat takes place in. Each square in a battle map is considered to be a 1 square meter area. Creatures such as <a data-href=\"Player Characters\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Player Characters</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Introduction to Monsters\" data-href=\"Introduction to Monsters\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/monsters/introduction-to-monsters.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monsters</a> can be represented with tokens or similar objects on this battle map.Battle maps can be virtual or physical, depending on the medium of play.Each turn takes approximately 10 seconds in game.\nThese are regular actions. Mostly, only one action can be taken during a turn. During a turn, one rapid action can be taken alongside a regular action.\nA rapid action is mutually exclusive with a prepared action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn. During a turn, one prepared action can be taken alongside a regular action.\nThis kind of actions always come with a trigger, and they are always performed outside a character's turn.\nPrepared actions last until end of the current round, unless explicitly told otherwise.\nA prepared action is mutually exclusive with a rapid action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn.\nSome prepared actions may mention \"moving into, out of or within an area\". In this case, the attack is done after the creature successfully moves to a new square on the battle map, even if it would be out of range otherwise. <br>These actions can be taken by any player character as long as they fulfill the requirements. See <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Special Actions\" data-href=\"Special Actions\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/special-actions.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the list of special actions</a>.\nAt the start phase of every round, turn order will be calculated for this round. There are several rules:\nEvery creature in combat is ordered in terms of their initiative value from highest to lowest.\nAllies with same initiative value must determine who goes first beforehand. This can only be changed in the end phase during combat.\nIf there are creatures with equal initiative in at least any two sides in the combat, the following rules are applied: The conflicting sides roll a d20 each.\nFor conflicting turn order spots, higher rolling teams' members will go earlier than the lower rolling teams' members with the same initiative.\nIf there is a draw, another set of d20s must be rolled between the drawing sides. A creature can only have one turn within one round, even if it is next in initiative order.\nEffects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"hits\" trigger and end during the recipient's turns: If a creature is bleeding for one hit, they will take bleeding damage at the start of their next turn and the bleeding ends. If the bleeding has a duration of two or more hits, then one hit will be spent when the bleeding damage happens. Effects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"rounds\" end at the start of the turns of their owners.\n<br>See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Battle Map\" data-href=\"#Battle Map\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Battle_Map_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle Maps</a>\nDuring combat, a creature can move within the battle map grid. There are various types of moving, which are explained below.Movement speed of a creature is equal to:\n(base movement speed + other bonuses) squares/round\nBase movement speed: Most creatures have a base movement speed of 6 by default.\nWalking is the simplest way of movement. a creature's walking speed is equal to its movement speed, normally. Instead of taking an action, a creature might \"walk\" twice. This is called \"running\" and unless specified otherwise, it is equal to double the walking speed.\nA running creature can't take actions, rapid actions, prepared actions or full-turn actions. If a creature can fly, their flight speed is equal to their walking speed unless specified otherwise. Flight speed can be used vertically or horizontally. However, ascending takes up 3 flight speed per meter ascended.\nA flying creature can't use its walking speed unless they land.\nIf a creature is flying, they are unaffected by any effects on the ground, unless the effect is tall enough to reach it. There are two kinds of rough terrain: light and heavy. Walking or running through light rough terrain such as soft sand or shallow water takes up 2 walking speed per meter walked.\nWalking through heavy rough terrain such as quicksand takes up 3 walking speed per meter walked.\nSwimming, climbing and crawling are considered heavy rough terrain. Precision rolls determine whether a weapon attack, a technique or any other ability succeeds against an unwilling target. A precision roll is done against a resistance, such as Parry or Evasion. If the result of this roll exceeds or is equal to the resistance it is rolled against, the roll succeeds and the technique or attack connects. Additionally, if you roll a 10 with a precision roll's d10, the roll succeeds regardless of the relevant resistance. A precision roll is calculated according to this formula:\n1d10 + (level)/2 + weapon precision bonus + other bonusesTerms in this formula are explained below:\nLevel: Your character's current level.\nWeapon precision bonus: This bonus is determined by the type of the weapon held in main hand.\nOther bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.In some cases, a specific spell, an ability or an attack might include a precision bonus or penalty itself.Some abilities may affect multiple targets. In this case, multiple precision rolls are required to determine which targets get affected by this ability.When a creature takes damage, this damage value reduces their health.Damage done to a target is calculated according to this formula:\nAction damage + potency + other bonuses - target's armorTerms in this formula are explained below:\nAction damage: Action damage is the damage of the respective ability.\nPotency: Equal to the potency aptitude of the character dealing the damage.\nOther bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.<br>\nTarget's armor: Armor is explained in the <a data-href=\"#Armor\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Armor_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Armor</a> section. In some cases, a specific ability might include a potency bonus or penalty itself. As an example, let's take an ability which includes the phrase \"potency bonus to damage is halved for this attack\". This simply means \"potency\" is divided by two in the formula:\nAction damage + (potency)/2 + other bonuses - target's armorEach creature has two kinds of armor: physical armor and magical armor. Normally, damage from weapon attacks and similar abilities are affected by physical armor and damage from magical techniques are affected by magical armor. If something is an exception to this rule, this is noted in the description of that ability.For an ability to be considered a \"damaging ability\", it should have a base damage. Examples could be abilities like \"Shield Bash\" or the hatchet's \"Hack\". Some actions only apply a status effect, but do not have a base damage. These abilities are not considered damaging abilities.Extra damage is a completely different packet of damage that just shares the precision roll of another attack. Extra damage has its own values for action damage, potency, bonuses and it is affected by armor separately from the delivering attack.On the other hand, bonus damage is just added into the delivering attack's damage calculation. Specifically, into the \"other bonuses\" term.\nWhen a player character falls below 0 health, they are considered \"unconscious\".\nAn unconscious character is considered prone.\nIf a player character takes damage equal to or more than double their base maximum health in total, they die immediately.\nAt the end phase of each round, unconscious characters make a death save roll against increased thresholds: Death save rolls are calculated with this formula: (1d10 + level/2)\n1st round: 3\n2nd round: 5\n3rd round: 7\n4th round: 9 A character dies if they fail any of their death saves or when they reach their 5th consecutive round in unconscious state. If a character is healed to at least 1 health during unconscious state, they become conscious again and they are considered prone. A creature is adjacent to another if there aren't any battle map squares between them. Significant height difference between two creatures due to environmental factors may break adjacency. During battle, whenever a creature has two or more adjacent foes wielding melee weapons, it is considered flanked.\nAttacking a flanked creature grants a +1 bonus to precision rolls done with melee abilities.\nA significant difference in elevation affects projectile attacks' precision rolls:\nAttacking from high ground grants you a +1 bonus.\nAttacking from low ground gives you a -1 penalty. When a character is behind cover, they are semi-protected against projectile attacks or abilities.\nThere are 3 types of cover: Quarter Cover: +1 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.\nHalf Cover: +2 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.\nFull Cover: +4 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles. Having other creatures in the way while determining cover counts as half cover. This doesn't increase with the amount of creatures in the way.\nIf a creature is completely blocked from another's point of view, they are out of line of sight and can't be interacted with targeted attacks and techniques.\nAbilities, techniques and attacks which affect an area may require hearing or sight: Sounds can't pass rocks, deep water and similar materials.\nSounds can pass 1 meter of wood, metal, shallow water and other similar materials.\nCover of any kind doesn't break line of sight.\nMagical remote eyes and ears count as sight and hearing for the purposes of these kind of effects.\nThere may be magical effects which can break line of sight or block sounds. A creature can go into prone voluntarily if they give up half of their base movement speed as a part of their movement during their turn.\nWhen a creature falls or goes prone, they have to be in movement phase of their turn and use half of their base movement speed to get up.\nA prone creature has half cover against projectiles.\nA prone creature has -2 to all resistances against abilities used within melee range, including projectiles.\nA prone creature can only do their basic weapon attack, dealing half damage and ignoring weapon precision. A character takes fall damage when they fall more than 5 meters.\nThis damage is armor-ignoring and it is calculated as such: Fall damage = 10 x (fall distance in meters - 5) When the party ambushes or gets ambushed by one or more foes, the ambushed side is considered disadvantageous and they receive the following effects for the next round of combat:\n-2 penalty on initiative\n-1 penalty on all precision rolls\n-1 penalty on all resistances Summoner can control their minions during combat. A minion disappears immediately when its summoner dies.\nSummoners have a simple telepathic bond to their minions. A summoner will know where a minion is and how much damage it suffered at all times. The minions follow the regular initiative order. On a turn a minion is summoned, if they have higher initiative than their summoner, they take their turn immediately after the summoner.\nMinions gain potency bonus to their damage normally, according to their relevant potency stat.\nMinions don't use energy and energy for their skills, unless specified otherwise.\nWhen a creature transforms into another, several rules should be followed:\nA creature can only use the abilities of what it transformed into, and its stats are set to the stats of the new form. Status effects or abilities with durations are unaffected by transforming. <br>When returning to the original form, a creature's health is set to what it was before the transformation. Going below 0 health does not break the transformation. See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Combat > Death\" data-href=\"Combat#Death\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Death_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">death</a>.\nIf a creature is unwillingly transformed during its own turn, the turn immediately ends.\nIf the new form is too large or small for the environment, the creature takes 5 armor-ignoring damage and the transformation fails.\n<br><a href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc?query=tag:TODO\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TODO\">#TODO</a> Conflicts between player characters should be resolved with words. However, sometimes arguments might escalate into fights, duels or even ambushes. In this case, rather than getting into a combat, the GM may opt to use the simple method of PvP instead:\nPlayers split into teams or stay neutral.\nEach team rolls a d10 per player. The team that rolls the highest in total wins.\nA team may get up to a +2 bonus to its total roll if it has advantage over other teams.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Phases of Combat","level":1,"id":"Phases_of_Combat_0"},{"heading":"Rules of Combat","level":1,"id":"Rules_of_Combat_0"},{"heading":"Battle Map","level":2,"id":"Battle_Map_0"},{"heading":"Action Types and Timing","level":2,"id":"Action_Types_and_Timing_0"},{"heading":"Action","level":3,"id":"Action_0"},{"heading":"Rapid Action","level":3,"id":"Rapid_Action_0"},{"heading":"Prepared Action","level":3,"id":"Prepared_Action_0"},{"heading":"Special Actions","level":3,"id":"Special_Actions_0"},{"heading":"Turn Order","level":2,"id":"Turn_Order_0"},{"heading":"Ability Durations","level":2,"id":"Ability_Durations_0"},{"heading":"Movement","level":2,"id":"Movement_0"},{"heading":"Walking","level":3,"id":"Walking_0"},{"heading":"Running","level":3,"id":"Running_0"},{"heading":"Flying","level":3,"id":"Flying_0"},{"heading":"Rough Terrain","level":3,"id":"Rough_Terrain_0"},{"heading":"Precision Rolls","level":2,"id":"Precision_Rolls_0"},{"heading":"Damage","level":2,"id":"Damage_0"},{"heading":"Armor","level":3,"id":"Armor_0"},{"heading":"Damaging Ability","level":3,"id":"Damaging_Ability_0"},{"heading":"\"Extra damage\" versus \"Bonus damage\"","level":3,"id":"\"Extra_damage\"_versus_\"Bonus_damage\"_0"},{"heading":"Death","level":2,"id":"Death_0"},{"heading":"Adjacency","level":2,"id":"Adjacency_0"},{"heading":"Flanking","level":3,"id":"Flanking_0"},{"heading":"High and Low Ground","level":2,"id":"High_and_Low_Ground_0"},{"heading":"Cover and Line of Sight","level":2,"id":"Cover_and_Line_of_Sight_0"},{"heading":"Falling Prone","level":2,"id":"Falling_Prone_0"},{"heading":"Fall Damage","level":2,"id":"Fall_Damage_0"},{"heading":"Ambushes","level":2,"id":"Ambushes_0"},{"heading":"Summoning","level":2,"id":"Summoning_0"},{"heading":"Transforming","level":2,"id":"Transforming_0"},{"heading":"Mounted Combat","level":2,"id":"Mounted_Combat_0"},{"heading":"Player versus Player","level":2,"id":"Player_versus_Player_0"}],"links":["sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#_0","sigil-of-uchma/monsters/introduction-to-monsters.html#_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/special-actions.html#_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Battle_Map_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Armor_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Death_0","?query=tag:TODO"],"author":"TaygaHoshi","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1744020128988,"modifiedTime":1744004750895,"sourceSize":13891,"sourcePath":"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat.md","exportPath":"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html":{"title":"Player Characters","icon":"","description":"Player characters are the other part, alongside the Game Master, of Sigil of Uchma.

Aptitude points can be spent on either Potency (P) or Control (C):\nPotency (P) usually increases the strength of abilities, meanwhile\nControl (C) usually increases the duration and size of abilities.\nYour path determines your base health. There are three tiers of maximum health:Energy is used for performing techniques and other abilities. As your character levels up, your base energy increases:Resistances lower the accuracy of incoming hits. They act as the success thresholds of precision rolls. List of resistances is given below:If an ability doesn't specify what resistance it is used against, it will either use Parry or Warding depending whether or not it is a magical ability.Resistances are determined by stats, equipment, and other various things. At level 1, you can choose to focus on certain resistances:\nYou can choose one resistance to be \"major\" and another one to be \"minor\".\nAlternatively, you can choose three resistances to be \"minor\".\nResistance choices affect their scaling:Techniques are special abilities which usually cost energy to activate. A player character can choose a technique from their path every even level, and from their branch every odd level:<br>See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat > Movement\" data-href=\"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat#Movement\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Movement_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Movement</a>.<br>See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat > Turn Order\" data-href=\"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat#Turn Order\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Turn_Order_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Turn Order</a>.\nEach player character has a base initiative of 0.

Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:\nBe able to sit or lie down. Be relaxed.\nBe in a safe environment.\nSleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:\nThey have a place to sleep.\nThey are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.\nSleeping and resting, normally, have the following benefits:\nWhile sleeping, you regenerate 10 health per hour and 2 energy per hour until level 5. Starting from level 5, you regenerate 3 energy per hour instead. While only resting, you regenerate 5 health and 1 energy per hour.\nHowever, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.When moving between points of interest with large distances between them, a player character can usually walk 25 kilometers in a day, from early morning to sunset. This is called \"travel speed\". If all members of a party is traveling on horseback or with a carriage, travel speed is doubled. There are various conditions that may affect the distance:\nParticularly good routes such as paved roads and good weather increase travel speed by 10 kilometers.\nDifficult routes and especially bad weather reduce travel speed by 10 kilometers each, depending on the conditions.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters > Encumbrance\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Encumbrance\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Encumbrance_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Encumbrance</a> also affects travel speed, explained in the next section. Minimum travel speed is 5 kilometers on foot and 15 kilometers on horseback or with a carriage. Below this, travel using that route is considered impassable.\nA player character can keep some items on their person. When a player character wants to put an item into their inventory and it is not easy to see how they would achieve this, the player has to briefly explain their reasoning to other players and the GM. In some cases, properties of an object might be as important as its size and weight. A thin rope might not have that much mass but it is difficult to carry around as it might unravel. Containers help with items like this. There are many items that can act as a container: backpacks, pouches, boxes, belts, leather straps and more. <br>Not every object can be accessed with the same speed. A bedroll deep in a backpack might take several minutes to take out, while a small flask of potion hanging from the backpack can be used almost immediately. This means only items in quick access slots can be used with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Special Actions > Use Item\" data-href=\"Special Actions#Use Item\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/special-actions.html#Use_Item_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">use item</a> special action.

Each player controls a single player character (PC). Through their PCs, players can explore the world, battle enemies, interact with NPCs, pursue and complete quests, find treasures and go on adventures.\nSigil is not yet ready for running campaigns.

There are only rarely limitations: a Shaman can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.Furthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.Unique items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:\nThis game has owl vampires, charming snake-humans, Central Asia themed spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:\nSigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Many cases of moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.Sigil of Uchma is versioned using a simple release cycle consisting of the following stages:\nAlpha (v1-a)\nBeta (v1-b)\nFeature freeze (v1-f)\nFull version release (v1)\n<br>You can contact me through GitHub or Discord.
