Combat has rules for resolving various situations that players and the GM might come across.A battle map is a grid of squares overlaid on top of a map, a sketch or a similar image depicting the location that the combat takes place in. Each square in a battle map is considered to be a 1 square meter area. Creatures can be represented with tokens or similar objects on this battle map.Each turn takes approximately 10 seconds in game.These are regular actions. Mostly, only one action can be taken during a turn.During a turn, one rapid action can be taken alongside a regular action.\nA rapid action is mutually exclusive with a prepared action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn.During a turn, one prepared action can be taken alongside a regular action.\nThis kind of actions always come with a trigger, and they are always performed outside a character's turn.\nPrepared actions last until end of the current round, unless explicitly told otherwise.\nA prepared action is mutually exclusive with a rapid action. Only one of them can be taken during a turn.These actions can be taken by any player character as long as they fulfill the requirements.

There are several rules:\nEvery creature in combat is ordered in terms of their initiative value from highest to lowest.\nAllies with same initiative value must determine who goes first beforehand. This can only be changed in the end phase during combat.\nIf there are creatures with equal initiative in at least any two sides in the combat, the following rules are applied: The conflicting sides roll a d20 each.\nFor conflicting turn order spots, higher rolling teams' members will go earlier than the lower rolling teams' members with the same initiative.\nIf there is a draw, another set of d20s must be rolled between the drawing sides. A creature can only have one turn within one round, even if it is next in initiative order.\nEffects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"hits\" trigger and end during the recipient's turns: If a creature is bleeding for one hit, they will take bleeding damage at the start of their next turn and the bleeding ends. If the bleeding has a duration of two or more hits, then one hit will be spent when the bleeding damage happens. Effects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"rounds\" end at the start of the turns of their owners.\n<br>See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Battle Map\" data-href=\"#Battle Map\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Battle_Map_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Battle Maps</a>\nDuring combat, a creature can move within the battle map grid. There are various types of moving, which are explained below.Movement speed of a creature is equal to:\n(base movement speed + other bonuses) squares/round\nBase movement speed: Most creatures have a base movement speed of 6 by default.\nWalking is the simplest way of movement. a creature's walking speed is equal to its movement speed, normally. Instead of taking an action, a creature might \"walk\" twice. This is called \"running\" and unless specified otherwise, it is equal to double the walking speed.\nA running creature can't take actions, rapid actions, prepared actions or full-turn actions. If a creature can fly, their flight speed is equal to their walking speed unless specified otherwise. Flight speed can be used vertically or horizontally. However, ascending takes up 3 flight speed per meter ascended.\nA flying creature can't use its walking speed unless they land.\nIf a creature is flying, they are unaffected by any effects on the ground, unless the effect is tall enough to reach it. There are two kinds of rough terrain: light and heavy. Walking or running through light rough terrain such as soft sand or shallow water takes up 2 walking speed per meter walked.\nWalking through heavy rough terrain such as quicksand takes up 3 walking speed per meter walked.\nSwimming, climbing and crawling are considered heavy rough terrain. Precision rolls determine whether a weapon attack, a technique or any other ability succeeds against an unwilling target. A precision roll is done against a resistance, such as Parry or Evasion. If the result of this roll exceeds or is equal to the resistance it is rolled against, the roll succeeds and the technique or attack connects. Additionally, if you roll a 10 with a precision roll's d10, the roll succeeds regardless of the relevant resistance. A precision roll is calculated according to this formula:\n1d10 + (level)/2 + weapon precision bonus + other bonusesTerms in this formula are explained below:\nLevel: Your character's current level.\nWeapon precision bonus: This bonus is determined by the type of the weapon held in main hand.\nOther bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.In some cases, a specific spell, an ability or an attack might include a precision bonus or penalty itself.Some abilities may affect multiple targets. In this case, multiple precision rolls are required to determine which targets get affected by this ability.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Phases of Combat","level":1,"id":"Phases_of_Combat_0"},{"heading":"Rules of Combat","level":1,"id":"Rules_of_Combat_0"},{"heading":"Battle Map","level":2,"id":"Battle_Map_0"},{"heading":"Action Types and Timing","level":2,"id":"Action_Types_and_Timing_0"},{"heading":"Action","level":3,"id":"Action_0"},{"heading":"Rapid Action","level":3,"id":"Rapid_Action_0"},{"heading":"Prepared Action","level":3,"id":"Prepared_Action_0"},{"heading":"Special Actions","level":3,"id":"Special_Actions_0"},{"heading":"Turn Order","level":2,"id":"Turn_Order_0"},{"heading":"Ability Durations","level":2,"id":"Ability_Durations_0"},{"heading":"Movement","level":2,"id":"Movement_0"},{"heading":"Walking","level":3,"id":"Walking_0"},{"heading":"Running","level":3,"id":"Running_0"},{"heading":"Flying","level":3,"id":"Flying_0"},{"heading":"Rough Terrain","level":3,"id":"Rough_Terrain_0"},{"heading":"Precision Rolls","level":2,"id":"Precision_Rolls_0"}],"links":["sigil-of-uchma/content/special-actions.html#_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Battle_Map_0"],"author":"TaygaHoshi","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733700542084,"modifiedTime":1733699403002,"sourceSize":12365,"sourcePath":"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Combat.md","exportPath":"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html":{"title":"Player Characters","icon":"","description":"Player characters are the other part, alongside the Game Master, of Sigil of Uchma.

Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:\nBe able to sit or lie down. Be relaxed.\nBe in a safe environment.\nSleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:\nThey have a place to sleep.\nThey are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.\nResting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:\nCharacters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping, up to the their base health.\nSimilarly, 2 points of energy regenerates per hour while sleeping, up to the character's base energy.\nWhile only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.\nHowever, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way.

The name is a reference to historical usage of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)\" target=\"_self\">Nazar amulets</a>.It is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their PCs, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and more.Sigil of Uchma is an alternate history fantasy game. This means we are not bound strictly by Turkic mythology and lifestyle from early middle age and before. Things can be added, changed and removed. I highly recommend reading the resources in the section below.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Content/Player Characters\" data-href=\"Content/Player Characters\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Creating a character in Sigil of Uchma</a> (start here!)\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SigilofUchma\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SigilofUchma\" target=\"_self\">YouTube channel</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://forms.gle/7NwTYqGUWpBfBWNg8\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://forms.gle/7NwTYqGUWpBfBWNg8\" target=\"_self\">Feedback form</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project\" target=\"_self\">GitHub repository</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"RESOURCES\" data-href=\"RESOURCES\" href=\"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/resources.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Resources used as inspiration</a>\nFun and engaging turn-based combat:\nEach character consists of many unique but balanced choices: weapons provide both active and passive abilities, techniques carry an impact while not being overpowered, and armors are strong. Additionally there is no arbitrarily locking players out of features. A Shaman can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.Furthermore, Sigil of Uchma is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.Uniquely themed items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:\nSigil of Uchma has owl vampires, charming snake-humans, Central Asian spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:\nSigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Imagination can open up a lot of possibilities.Currently, the game is in alpha state. This means it is not ready for running campaigns yet. If you want to play the game anyway, I recommend sticking to one version and only updating if the newer version doesn't break the balance of the campaign.<br>You can contact me through GitHub or Discord.
