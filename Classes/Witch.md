## Witch Branches
#TODO 

## Witchcraft Expert
As a Witch, you are able to cast both simple and complex witchcraft spells.

## Attuning
As a rapid action, you can attune to the forces of nature for this round. While attuned, your spells are considered to have +1 bonuses to ARC and HAR. You can't attune if you moved more than half your movement speed this round, and your movement speed is halved while attuned.

## Spell Modifiers
Choose two modifiers each at levels 2 and 6. 
These modifiers cost 1 energy to apply to the next spell you cast, and a spell can have multiple modifiers.
1. #TODO 
2. *Homing:* This projectile spell curves slightly around obstacles. Cover penalties to this spell are reduced by 1.
3. *Improved range:* This spell's range is increased by 2 meters. This modifier does not affect radius of a spell.
4. *Selective effect:* This spell doesn't affect one creature you choose, aside from yourself.
5. *Self-shielding:* This spell grants you physical and magical temporary armor equal to half of its energy cost.
6. #TODO 
7. *Spell knockback:* This single-target damaging spell pushes its target one meter away from you. 
8. *Reduced duration:* This spell's duration is halved.
9. #TODO 
10. #TODO 

## Advanced Attuning
While attuning, you can use one spell modifier you have without spending energy cost.
