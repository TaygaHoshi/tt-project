**Magician Branches**
	#TODO 

**Elemental Affinity**
	Choose an element. Spells you cast and abilities you use with that element are considered to have a bonus +1 ARC.

**Spell Modifiers**
	Choose two modifiers each at levels 2 and 6. 
	These modifiers cost 1 mana to apply to the next spell you cast, and a spell can have multiple modifiers.
	1. #TODO 

**Casting Style**
	As you progress with your magic, you gain a casting style.
	1. Offensive casting: You gain a +1 to precision rolls to your damaging spells against targets who are actively in combat against you. 
	2. Defensive casting: While you are casting a spell, you gain a +2 bonus to all resistances against prepared actions such as interrupts, preemptive attacks and opportunistic attacks. 
	3. Combat casting: Your current weapon is always considered a magical weapon, and deal magical damage. This ability does not affect weapons' aptitudes.
	4. #TODO 

**Elemental Mastery**
	Before casting an elemental spell, you can choose to activate the effects of two elements for that spell by spending double the mana cost. You can choose which element's effect activates first. You can use this ability only once per round.
