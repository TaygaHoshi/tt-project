**Magician Branches**
	#TODO 

**Elemental Affinity**
	Choose an element. Spells you cast and abilities you use with that element are considered to have a bonus +1 ARC.

**Spell Modifiers**
	Choose two modifiers each at levels 2 and 6. 
	These modifiers cost 1 mana to apply to the next spell you cast, and a spell can have multiple modifiers.
	1. Defensive casting: 
		While you are casting this spell, you have a +2 bonus to all resistances against prepared actions such as interrupts, preemptive attacks and opportunistic attacks. 
	2. Armor piercing: 
		This damaging spell pierces 50% armor. This modifier can't be used on spells which can pierce armor.
	3. Improved range: 
		This spell's range is increased by 3 meters. This modifier does not affect radius of a spell.
	4. Shielded casting:
		This spell grants you either physical or magical temporary armor equal to half its mana cost. You can choose which type of temporary armor while applying this modifier.
	5. #TODO 

**Elemental Mastery**
	Before casting an elemental spell, you can choose to activate the effects of two elements for that spell by spending double the mana cost. You can choose which element's effect activates first. You can use this ability only once per round.
