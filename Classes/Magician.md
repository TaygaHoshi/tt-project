**Magician Branches**
	#TODO 

**Elemental Affinity**
	Choose an element. Spells you cast and abilities you use with that element are considered to have a bonus +1 ARC.

**Spell Modifiers**
	Choose two modifiers each at levels 2 and 6. 
	These modifiers cost 1 mana to apply to the next spell you cast, and a spell can have multiple modifiers.
	1. Defensive casting: 
		While you are casting this spell, you have a +2 bonus to all resistances against prepared actions such as interrupts, preemptive attacks and opportunistic attacks. 
	2. Armor piercing: 
		This damaging spell pierces 50% armor. This modifier can't be used on spells which can pierce armor.
	3. Improved range: 
		This spell's range is increased by 3 meters. This modifier does not affect radius of a spell.
	4. Shielded casting:
		This spell grants you either physical or magical temporary armor equal to half its mana cost. You can choose the type of temporary armor while applying this modifier.
	5. #TODO 
	6. #TODO 
	7. #TODO 
	8. #TODO 

**Attuning**
	As a rapid action, you can attune to the forces of nature. While attuned:
	1. Your spells are considered to have a bonus +1 ARC and gain a +1 bonus to their precision rolls.
	2. You can't use weapon attacks and combat techniques.
	3. You walk at half speed and can't fly, climb, swim or run.
	Attuning lasts at least until the end of next round. In the following rounds, you can stop attuning as a rapid action.

**Magical Enhancement**
	For 1 mana, you can enhance your body and weapon with your magic as a part of a weapon attack. This attack has a +1 bonus to its precision rolls and deals magical damage instead of physical damage. For this attack, your weapon is considered a magical weapon. You can use this ability only once per round.

**Extra Spell**
	You can learn an additional novice spell at level 8. This ability is already applied to the spell amount table.

**Elemental Mastery**
	Before casting an elemental spell, you can choose to activate the effects of two elements for that spell by spending double the mana cost. You can choose which element's effect activates first. You can use Elemental Mastery only once per round.
