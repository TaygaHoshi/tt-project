#TODO 

## Exploiting
Your damaging weapon attacks gain bonus damage equal to 5 plus half of your strength aptitude against foes who are either:
1. flanked,
2. prone,
3. suffering from a debilitating status effect, or
4. in lower terrain compared to you.

## Improvised Aid
You can spend 2 energy to tend to a willing creature you can touch as a rapid action, with whatever is available near you. You cure a debilitating or a harmful status effect of your choosing. Curing a status effect with this way also grants 5 temporary health for 1 round. 

## Survival Training
Choose one of the following abilities. You gain that ability against attacks from exploitable foes:
1. *Improved Reflexes*: You have a +1 bonus to Parry, Evasion and Reflection.
2. *Strong Will:* You have a +1 bonus to Constitution, Favor and Willpower.
