## Scout Branches

## Combat Training
As a Scout, you can use both simple and advanced combat techniques.

## Improvised Aid
You can spend 1 energy to tend to a willing creature you can touch as an action, with whatever is available near you. You cure a debilitating or a harmful status effect of your choosing, and then grant 5 temporary health for 1 round. This ability counts as a combat technique.

## Versatile Reflexes
#TODO 

## Resourcefulness
Before using improvised aid, you can spend an additional point of energy to gain one of the following benefits:
1. *Practical Thinking:* You can use improvised aid as a rapid action.
2. *Bandage:* Cure an additional status effect, and grant (5+POW/2) temporary health for (1+DEX/2) rounds instead.
3. *Rebound:* This ally's next damaging ability done within (1+DEX/2) rounds gains a +5 bonus to its damage.

## Survival Training
Gain a +1 bonus to a minor or lower resistance of your choosing. As a rapid action, you can move this bonus to any resistance of a creature you can touch for 1 round.

## Skillful Scout
You gain a +2 bonus to 2 different common skills of your choosing.
