## Scout Branches
#TODO 

## Exploiting
Your non-damaging combat techniques gain a +1 to their POW, and your basic weapon attacks gain a +3 bonus damage against:
1. flanked foes,
2. foes with any debilitating status effects, 
3. prone foes, and
4. foes in lower terrain compared to you.

## Improvised Aid
You can spend 2 stamina to tend to yourself as an action, or a willing creature you can touch as a rapid action, with whatever is available near you. You can either:
1. Cure a debilitating or a harmful status effect of your choosing, or
2. Grant 10 temporary health for 1 round.
