# Soldier (ê∞Äê∞º)
Soldiers can be honorable warriors, bounty hunters, master swordsmen and more. They can take any size, shape or form; some of them are lone wolves who rely only on brute force, some know a difficult task requires strong allies and some can even use magic.

## Critical Training
Your critical hits with damaging weapon attacks and combat techniques gain a (5 + potency) bonus to their damage, depending on their aptitudes.
If you roll a 9 for a precision roll of a weapon attack or a combat technique, you can convert this roll into a critical hit by using 2 energy.

## Style Specialization
Choose one style to start specializing in. You gain the listed benefits of that style.
1. *Strength specialization:* Combat techniques you perform are considered to have +1 POW and gain a +1 bonus to their precision rolls. This ability works normally when a combat technique modifies another action.
2. *Endurance specialization:* Spending aptitude points on VIT increases your maximum health by 2. This includes previously spent points.
3. *Magical specialization:* Choose any simple novice spell. You can cast this spell by spending energy as normal.

## Armor Training 1
Choose a type of armor, and one passive effect. You gain that effect while wearing this armor type.
1. *Efficiency:* You do not gain the resistance penalties from being stunned or prone.
2. *Impenetrable defense:* You are immune to any type of armor piercing. This also affects your shield.
3. *Like the wind*: When you charge or run, you gain a +1 bonus to your Parry and Evasion for 1 round.

## Weapon Mastery
Choose one weapon ability. 
1. *Keen rejuvenation:* Your critical hits with weapons regenerate 1 energy. 
2. *Dynamic vision:* If you are wielding any weapon, you have a +1 bonus to Parry against prepared actions and you cannot be flanked.

## Armor Training 2
When you gain temporary armor of one type, you also gain an equal amount of the other type for the same duration. This ability only works if you are wearing the armor type you previously chose.
