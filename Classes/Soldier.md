# Soldier (ê∞Äê∞º)
Soldiers can be honorable warriors, bounty hunters, master swordsmen and more. They can take any size, shape or form; some of them are lone wolves who rely only on brute force, some know a difficult task requires strong allies and some can even use magic.

## Critical Training
If you roll a 10 on a precision roll's d10 with a damaging ability, it gains a (5 + potency) bonus to its damage, depending on their aptitudes.
You can spend 2 energy to get the same benefits if you rolled a 9 with the d10. 

## Style Specialization
Choose one style to start specializing in. You gain the listed benefits of that style.
1. *Strength specialization:* Combat techniques you perform are considered to have +2 POW. This ability works normally when a combat technique modifies another action.
2. *Endurance specialization:* VIT increases your health by 3 points instead of 2.
3. *Magical specialization:* Choose any simple novice spell. You can cast this spell by spending energy as normal.
