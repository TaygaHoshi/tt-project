# Release Cycle
TT Project will use a simple release cycle consisting of the following stages:
1. Alpha of next version
2. Beta of next version
3. Feature freeze of next version
4. Full version release

# Alpha Stage
During alpha stage, features, mechanics and content will be incomplete, experimental and unbalanced. This part allows free experimenting.

Alpha stages are tagged in this format: v1-a4. 
This sample tag means (4th alpha release of version 1).

# Beta Stage
This stage is where the majority of the playable content gets added. Mechanics will be mostly finished.

Beta stages are tagged in this format: v1-b2. 
This sample tag means (2nd beta release of version 1).

# Feature Freeze Stage
This stage is for fixing typos and further gameplay balancing. Hopefully no new content will be added during this stage.

Feature freeze stages are tagged in this format: v1-f3. 
This sample tag means (3rd feature freeze release of version 1).

# Full Version Release
At this point, an ebook for this version will be released. This is where players can pick up the game and play. The cycle begins with the first alpha for the next version.

Full versions will be tagged in this format: v2
This sample tag means (version 2).
