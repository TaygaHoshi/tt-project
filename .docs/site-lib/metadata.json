are objects or places of immense magical power; be it an eternal fireplace, an ever-filling urn, the tree of life or even a mountain. No matter the type, however, every icon has a common quality: they were created before the making of the physical world, and thus are not composed of the elements.Practitioners of this type of magic are worshippers of their icon and they use symbolic manifestations of it to perform techniques called \"rituals\". When you choose iconcraft as your branch, the first technique you take needs to be a ritual.Choose an icon when you take this branch. You receive a small object representing it in return, called a totem. You can recall your totem to yourself as an action. A totem can be partially or fully destroyed, making it lose its powers. A destroyed totem magically restores itself within at most 12 hours depending on the degree of damage it suffered. Your totem can be used in a variety of ways:\nYour rituals originate from your totem.\nIf you hold your totem like a weapon in either hand, you can perform a lesser variant of a ritual of your choice in a one meter radius around you by spending 1 energy per round. This ability ends if you stop holding your totem.\nYou can tap into your icon's power through your totem as a full-turn action, halving the cost of the next ritual you perform, down to a minimum of 1 energy.\nIf you are in the vicinity of your icon, your totem stops functioning. Instead, you can receive power from your icon directly. Your rituals:\noriginate from your icon, have double the radius, cost no energy to cast, and\nare considered to have 10 of both aptitudes. Rituals of icon magic are techniques with two special properties:\nYou can have at most one ritual active at any time, and you can stop your rituals freely.\nYour rituals do not affect you, and creatures carrying totems of your icon, unless specified otherwise.\nAreas of effect of rituals are clearly visible, and followers of the same icon can tell which ritual is currently active from the appearance of this effect. Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Rapid action\nCost: 1 energy\nEffect\nYour currently active ritual also affects you for 3 rounds. Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Rapid action\nCost: 2 energy\nEffect\nYou can use this technique if you are currently performing a ritual. This ritual's radius is doubled, but lasts only for (1 + C/2) rounds.Category: Offense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 4 energy\nRadius: (3 + C/3) meters\nDuration: (1 + C/6) rounds\nEffect\nThis technique does not require precision rolls.\nSummon a shadow of your icon on your current location for the duration. Creatures starting their turns within the radius take 10 magical damage, fall prone and receive immobilized for 1 round.\nCreatures carrying totems of your icon are unaffected by this technique, but rituals around these totems immediately end. Category: Offense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nThis ritual does not require precision rolls.\nYour icon strengthens the creatures within the area, granting their weapon attacks (3 + P/2) bonus damage. Category: Offense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nThis ritual does not require precision rolls.\nYour icon acts as a catalyzer for curses. Whenever a creature within this area is applied a harmful status effect, its duration is increased by 1 hit.Category: Defense\nAgainst: Constitution\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nYour icon manifests an area of banishment. Make a precision roll against any creature who end their turn within this area. If this roll succeeds, that creature is pushed (1 + P/4) meters away from the center of this area. Category: Defense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nThis ritual does not require precision rolls.\nA shadow is cast upon the area by your icon, improving effectiveness of taking cover by one step:\n1. No cover becomes quarter cover\n2. Quarter covers become half cover\n3. Half covers become full cover\n4. Full covers break line of sightCategory: Utility\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nA soundproof barrier encompassing the area is created by your icon's power. Sounds from outside cannot be heard within the radius, and sounds from within cannot be heard outside.Category: Utility\nAgainst: Constitution\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nA semi-transparent fog falls upon the area around your totem, weighing down creatures within radius. Make a precision roll against any creature starting or ending their turn within this area. If this roll succeeds, the creature receives slowed and weakened defenses for 1 round. Category: Defense\nExecution Time: Full-turn action\nCost: 6 energy\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: 1 hour\nEffect\nThis ritual does not require precision rolls.\nObjects within the radius are enhanced with your icon's magic. Creatures starting their turns within the area gain 5 temporary physical armor for 1 round, while non-living objects become twice as resistant to damage and breaking.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Icons and Totems","level":1,"id":"Icons_and_Totems_0"},{"heading":"Totem","level":2,"id":"Totem_0"},{"heading":"Source of Power","level":2,"id":"Source_of_Power_0"},{"heading":"Ritual Casting","level":2,"id":"Ritual_Casting_0"},{"heading":"Techniques","level":1,"id":"Techniques_0"},{"heading":"Affect Self","level":2,"id":"Affect_Self_0"},{"heading":"Extend Ritual","level":2,"id":"Extend_Ritual_0"},{"heading":"Manifest","level":2,"id":"Manifest_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Empowering","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Empowering_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Catalysis","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Catalysis_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Repulsion","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Repulsion_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Shrouding","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Shrouding_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Silence","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Silence_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Stagnation","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Stagnation_0"},{"heading":"Ritual of Unbreaking","level":2,"id":"Ritual_of_Unbreaking_0"}],"links":[],"author":"TaygaHoshi","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://sigil.tyghsh.cc/sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/iconcraft.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1758775775435,"modifiedTime":1767493772252,"sourceSize":5904,"sourcePath":"sigil-of-uchma/Character - Branches/Iconcraft.md","exportPath":"sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/iconcraft.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":["sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html"],"type":"markdown"},"sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/warwise.html":{"title":"Warwise","icon":"","description":"The Warwise concern themselves not with the foe in front of them, but the whole battlefield.

End of round Return to round start if the combat is continuing. Combat has rules for resolving various situations that players and the GM might come across.A battle map is a grid of squares overlaid on top of a map, a sketch or a similar image depicting the location that the combat takes place in. Each square in a battle map is a 1 square meter area. Creatures such as <a data-href=\"Player Characters\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Player Characters</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Introduction to Monsters\" data-href=\"Introduction to Monsters\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/monsters/introduction-to-monsters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Monsters</a> can be represented with tokens or similar objects on this battle map. Battle maps can be virtual or physical, depending on the medium of play.Sigil of Uchma has two rule variations for calculating distances on a battle map:\nGame distance\nSimulation distance\nGame distance\nWith this rule, one square of diagonal distance is treated the same as one square of orthogonal distance. As a result, movement and ability ranges form a cube-like area of effect. This is the default rule.Simulation distance\nThis variant rule produces more realistic measurements and can be used if the additional calculations and tracking is acceptable, especially when using virtual tabletops. With this rule, diagonal movement alternates between 1 meter and 2 meters, causing movement and ability ranges to be more circular. This creates the same effect as counting two diagonal squares as equal to three orthogonal squares.During combat, a creature can move within the battle map grid for a distance up to its speed. There are various types of speeds used for different types of movement, which are explained below.\nWalking is the simplest way of movement. Instead of taking an action, a creature might \"walk\" twice. This is called \"running\" and unless specified otherwise, it is equal to double the walking speed.\nA running creature can't take actions, rapid actions, prepared actions or full-turn actions. If a creature can fly, their walking speed is equal to half of its flying speed unless specified otherwise. Flying speed can be used vertically or horizontally. However, ascending for 1 meter requires 2 meters of flying speed per meter ascended.\nA flying creature can't use its walking speed unless it lands.\nFlying creatures are unaffected by effects on the ground unless the effect reaches their altitude. There are two kinds of rough terrain: light and heavy. Walking or running through light rough terrain such as soft sand or shallow water takes up 2 walking speed per meter walked.\nWalking through heavy rough terrain such as quicksand takes up 3 walking speed per meter walked.\nMovement via swimming, climbing and crawling is considered to be in heavy rough terrain. Each round takes approximately 10 seconds in game.These are regular actions. Mostly, only one action can be taken during a turn.There are two kinds of minor actions: rapid actions and prepared actions. Mostly, only one minor action can be taken during a turn.Rapid Action\nDuring a turn, one rapid action can be taken alongside a regular action.Prepared Action\nDuring a turn, one prepared action can be taken alongside a regular action. Actions of this type always come with a trigger, and they are always executed outside a character's turn. Prepared actions last until end of the current round, unless explicitly told otherwise.Some prepared actions may mention \"moving into, out of or within an area\". In this case, the attack is done after the creature successfully moves to a new square on the battle map, even if it would be out of range otherwise. A full-turn action takes up your whole turn, meaning you can't move or use any other type of action.\nPrecision rolls determine whether a weapon attack, a technique or any other ability succeeds against an unwilling target. A precision roll is done against a resistance, such as Parry or Evasion. If the result of this roll exceeds or is equal to the resistance it is rolled against, the roll succeeds and the technique or attack connects. A precision roll is calculated according to this formula:\nTerms in this formula are explained below:\nLevel: Your character's current level.\nWeapon precision bonus: This bonus is determined by the type of the weapon held in main hand.\nOther bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.In some cases, a specific spell, an ability or an attack might include a precision bonus or penalty itself. Moreover, some abilities may affect multiple targets. In this case, multiple precision rolls are required to determine which targets get affected by this ability.Unless specified otherwise, all of the resistances of non-living objects are zero.When a creature takes damage, this damage value reduces their health. Damage done to a target is calculated according to this formula:\nTerms in this formula are explained below:\nAction damage: Action damage is the damage of the respective ability.\nPotency: Equal to the potency aptitude of the character dealing the damage.\nOther bonuses: These are bonuses or penalties which come from various sources like status effects, environment and the like.<br>\nTarget's armor: Armor is explained in the <a data-href=\"#Armor\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Armor_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Armor</a> section. In some cases, a specific ability might include a potency bonus or penalty itself. As an example, let's take an ability which includes the phrase \"potency bonus to damage is halved for this attack\". This simply means \"potency\" is divided by two in the formula:\nEach creature has two kinds of armor: physical armor and magical armor. Normally, damage from physical weapon attacks and similar abilities are affected by physical armor and damage from magical techniques or magical weapons are affected by magical armor. If something is an exception to this rule, this is noted in the description of that ability.For an ability to be considered a \"damaging ability\", it should have a base damage. Examples could be abilities like \"Shield Bash\" or the hatchet's \"Hack\". Some actions only apply a status effect, but do not have a base damage. These abilities are not considered damaging abilities.Extra damage is a completely different packet of damage that just shares the precision roll of another attack. Extra damage has its own values for action damage, potency, bonuses and it is affected by armor separately from the delivering attack.On the other hand, bonus damage is just added into the delivering attack's damage calculation. Specifically, into the \"other bonuses\" term.Some abilities, magic items or creatures may have health stealing effects. This is always considered magical damage. When a creature tries to steal health, the amount it gains is equal to the health loss of target. Unless specified otherwise, health stealing abilities use normal damage calculation. For example, if an ability steals 20 health and the target has 5 magical armor, the user of the ability would be healed for 15. At the start of the combat, determine turn order as follows:\nEvery opposing group rolls a flat .\n• Each group must end with a different roll result; reroll as needed until all results are unique.\n• If a new opposing group enters the combat later, they also roll a flat . If their result matches an existing group, only the new group rerolls until they have a unique result.\nAll creatures in combat are ordered from highest to lowest based on their current movement speed.\n• If a creature that has a flying speed is currently on the ground, use its walking speed instead of its flying speed.\nResolve ties in movement speed as follows:\n• Allies with the same movement speed decide their acting order beforehand. This order may be changed during combat using the speak common action.\n• Enemies with the same movement speed use the flat results from step 1 to determine who acts first.\nA creature can only take one turn per round, even if it would appear again later in the order.\nEffects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"hits\" trigger and end during the recipient's turns: If a creature is bleeding for one hit, they will take bleeding damage at the start of their next turn and the bleeding ends. If the bleeding has a duration of two or more hits, then one hit will be spent when the bleeding damage happens. Effects of abilities with a duration of one or more \"rounds\" end at the start of the turns of their owners.\nIf multiple effects would end at the same time, they end in the order of application. A creature is adjacent to another if there aren't any battle map squares between them. Significant height differences caused by the environment may break adjacency. During battle, whenever a creature has two or more adjacent foes wielding melee weapons, it is considered flanked.\nAttacking a flanked creature grants a +1 bonus to precision rolls done with melee abilities.\nA significant difference in elevation affects projectile attacks' precision rolls:\nAttacking from high ground grants you a +1 bonus.\nAttacking from low ground gives you a -1 penalty. When a character is behind cover, they are semi-protected against projectile attacks or abilities.\nThere are 3 types of cover: Quarter Cover: -1 penalty to precision rolls with projectile abilities.\nHalf Cover: -2 penalty to precision rolls with projectile abilities.\nFull Cover: -4 penalty to precision rolls with projectile abilities. Having other creatures in the way while determining cover counts as half cover. This doesn't increase with the amount of creatures in the way.\nCover does not stack, only the highest applicable one is used.\nIf a creature is completely blocked from another's point of view, they are out of line of sight and can't be interacted with targeted attacks and techniques.\nAbilities, techniques and attacks which affect an area may require hearing or sight: Sounds cannot pass through rocks, deep water, or similar materials.\nSounds can pass through up to 1 meter of wood, metal, shallow water, or similar materials.\nCover of any kind doesn't break line of sight.\nMagical remote eyes and ears count as sight and hearing for these effects.\nSome magical effects may break line of sight or block sounds. A creature can go into prone voluntarily if they give up half of their walking speed as a part of their movement during their turn.\nWhen a creature falls or goes prone, they need to use half of their walking speed to get up.\nA prone creature has quarter cover.\nAttacking a prone creature grants a +1 bonus to precision rolls when adjacent to that creature. This also includes projectile attacks. A prone creature can only do basic weapon attacks, dealing half damage after armor and ignoring weapon precision.\nWhen a flying creature is immobilized, or falls prone, it loses up to 3 meters of altitude and takes 5 armor-ignoring damage if it collides with the ground or an object.\nA character takes fall damage when they fall more than 5 meters. This damage is armor-ignoring and it is calculated as such:\nWhen the party ambushes or gets ambushed by one or more foes, the ambushed side is considered disadvantageous and they receive the following effects for the next round of combat:\n-2 penalty to movement speed, down to a minimum of 1 meter\n-1 penalty to all precision rolls by this creature\n+1 bonus to all precision rolls against this creature Summoner can control their minions during combat. A minion disappears immediately when its summoner dies.\nSummoners have a simple telepathic bond to their minions. A summoner will know where a minion is and how much damage it suffered at all times. The minions follow the regular turn order. On a turn a minion is summoned, if they have higher movement speed than their summoner, they take their turn immediately after the summoner.\nMinions gain potency bonus to their damage normally, according to their relevant potency stat.\nMinions don't use energy for their skills, unless specified otherwise.\nWhen a creature transforms into another, several rules should be followed:\nA creature can only use the abilities of what it transformed into, and its stats are set to the stats of the new form. Status effects or abilities with durations are unaffected by transforming. <br>When returning to the original form, a creature's health is set to what it was before the transformation. Going below 0 health does not break the transformation. See: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Combat &gt; Death\" data-href=\"Combat#Death\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Death\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">death</a>.\nIf a creature is unwillingly transformed during its own turn, this turn immediately ends.\nIf the new form cannot physically fit within the environment, the creature takes 5 armor-ignoring damage and the transformation fails.\n<br><a href=\".?query=tag:TODO\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TODO\">#TODO</a> Conflicts between player characters should be resolved with words. However, sometimes arguments might escalate into fights, duels or even ambushes. In this case, rather than starting a combat encounter, the GM may opt to use the simple method of PvP instead:\nPlayers split into teams or stay neutral.\nEach team rolls a per player.

As your character levels up, your base energy increases:<br>Energy is regained primarily via <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Resting and Sleeping\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Resting and Sleeping\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Resting_and_Sleeping_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">resting or sleeping</a>, which are described in the relevant section below. However, many of the classes allow you to manipulate energy in one way or another such as transferring energy between party members or using health instead of energy. Techniques are abilities of a character which usually cost energy to activate. A first level character will have access to two techniques, meanwhile another one who has reached maximum level will have 10 techniques available to them:Each player character can choose a starting equipment:\n<br>Any <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Armor Types and Armor Rating\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Armor Types and Armor Rating\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Armor Types and Armor Rating\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">armor type</a> of their choosing. This determines their physical and magical armor strength as well as their base <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Combat &gt; Movement\" data-href=\"Combat#Movement\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Movement\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">movement speed</a>.\n<br>Two <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Weapon Sets\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Weapon Sets\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Weapon Sets\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">weapon sets</a> using the basic weapon items.\nStarting from the first level and with each level up, a character gains one aptitude point that they can spend on one of the two aptitudes. The aptitudes affect the scaling of almost every ability in the game:\nPotency (P) usually increases the strength and damage of abilities.\nControl (C) usually increases the duration, range and radius of abilities as well as the character's skill rolls.\n<br>Resistances lower the accuracy of incoming hits. They act as the success thresholds to beat when doing a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Combat &gt; Precision Rolls\" data-href=\"Combat#Precision Rolls\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Precision Rolls\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">precision roll</a>. List of resistances is given below:If an ability doesn't specify what resistance it is used against, it will either be against Parry or Warding depending on its damage type.Resistances are determined by your level, equipment, and other various things. At level 1, you can choose to focus on certain resistances:\nYou can choose one resistance to be \"major\" and another one to be \"minor\".\nAlternatively, you can choose three resistances to be \"minor\".\nResistance choices affect their scaling:<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Skills\" data-href=\"Skills\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/skills.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Skills</a> are miscellaneous abilities of a character used for skill rolls, both of which are described in the relevant page. At first level, you can choose to focus on two skills as your character's major skills.Sigil of Uchma uses what is commonly known as milestone levelling, which means the player characters will gain one level when they reach specific points (called milestones) in the campaign at the GM's discretion.<br><a href=\".?query=tag:TODO\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#TODO\">#TODO</a>: Alternative rules for experience levelling<br>These actions can be taken by any player character as long as they fulfil the requirements. See <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Common Actions\" data-href=\"Common Actions\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the list of common actions</a>.Usually, a character requires 6 to 8 hours of sleep per day. Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Stacks of fatigue received in this way can only be removed by sleeping. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies.While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:\nBe able to sit or lie down. Be relaxed.\nBe in a safe environment.\nSleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:\nThey have a place to sleep.\nThey are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.\nSleeping and resting have the following benefits:\nWhile sleeping, you regenerate 10 health per hour and 2 energy per hour until level 6. Starting from level 6, you regenerate 3 energy per hour instead. While only resting, you regenerate 5 health and 1 energy per hour no matter your level.\nHowever, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.When moving between points of interest with large distances between them, a player character can usually walk 25 kilometers in a day, from early morning to sunset. This is called \"travel speed\". If all members of a party is travelling on horseback or with a carriage, travel speed is doubled. There are various conditions that may affect this speed, which are considered after the bonus from mounts:\nParticularly good routes such as paved roads and good weather increase travel speed by up to 10 kilometers.\nDifficult routes and especially bad weather reduce travel speed by 10 kilometers each, depending on the conditions.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Encumbrance\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Encumbrance\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Encumbrance_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Encumbrance</a> also affects travel speed, explained in the next section. Minimum travel speed is 5 kilometers on foot and 15 kilometers on horseback or with a carriage. Below this, travel using that route is considered impassable using the respective method.\nA player character can keep some items on their person. When a player character wants to put an item into their inventory and it is not easy to see how they would achieve this, the player has to briefly explain their reasoning to other players and the GM. In some cases, properties of an object might be as important as its size and weight. A thin rope might not have that much mass but it is difficult to carry around as it might unravel. Containers help with items like this. There are many items that can act as a container: backpacks, pouches, boxes, belts, leather straps and more. <br>Not every object can be accessed with the same speed. A bedroll deep in a backpack might take a minute or two to take out, while a small flask of potion hanging from the backpack can be used almost immediately. This means only items in quick access slots can be used with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Common Actions &gt; Use Item\" data-href=\"Common Actions#Use Item\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html#Use Item\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">use item</a> common action. Each player character has two quick access slots by default, and can place suitable items in them. Some containers might grant more slots, but a character can have 5 quick access slots at most. <br>A player character can wear one set of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Armor Types and Armor Rating\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Armor Types and Armor Rating\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Armor Types and Armor Rating\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">armor</a> and equip two <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Weapon Sets\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Weapon Sets\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Weapon Sets\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">weapon sets</a>. If you are carrying more than what would be comfortable or tolerable, you can choose to either drop some items or push yourself to keep carrying the heavy load:\nYou gain 1 stack of fatigue per hour of being encumbered, which is reduced by 1 stack per 30 minutes after you stop being encumbered. Your travel speed is reduced by 10 kilometers. When a player character falls below 1 health, they fall unconscious.\nAn unconscious character is considered prone, immobilized and stunned.\nIf a player character takes damage equal to or more than double their base maximum health in total, they die immediately.\nAt the end phase of each round, unconscious characters make a death save roll against increased thresholds: Death save rolls are calculated as 1st round: 3\n2nd round: 5\n3rd round: 7\n4th round: 9 A character dies if they fail any of their death saves or when they reach their 5th consecutive round in unconscious state. If a character is healed to at least 1 health during unconscious state, they become conscious again and they are considered prone. Temporary health does not count as healing for this purpose.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Creating a Character","level":1,"id":"Creating_a_Character_0"},{"heading":"Sample Characters","level":2,"id":"Sample_Characters_0"},{"heading":"Classes","level":2,"id":"Classes_0"},{"heading":"Energy","level":2,"id":"Energy_0"},{"heading":"Techniques","level":2,"id":"Techniques_0"},{"heading":"Starter Equipment","level":2,"id":"Starter_Equipment_0"},{"heading":"Aptitudes","level":2,"id":"Aptitudes_0"},{"heading":"Resistances","level":2,"id":"Resistances_0"},{"heading":"Skills","level":2,"id":"Skills_0"},{"heading":"Playing a Character","level":1,"id":"Playing_a_Character_0"},{"heading":"Levelling Up","level":2,"id":"Levelling_Up_0"},{"heading":"Common Actions","level":2,"id":"Common_Actions_0"},{"heading":"Resting and Sleeping","level":2,"id":"Resting_and_Sleeping_0"},{"heading":"Travelling","level":2,"id":"Travelling_0"},{"heading":"Inventory Management","level":2,"id":"Inventory_Management_0"},{"heading":"Containers","level":3,"id":"Containers_0"},{"heading":"Quick Access Slots","level":3,"id":"Quick_Access_Slots_0"},{"heading":"Equipment","level":3,"id":"Equipment_0"},{"heading":"Encumbrance","level":3,"id":"Encumbrance_0"},{"heading":"Death","level":2,"id":"Death_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:TODO","sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-warriors.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-sorcerers.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-guides.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-poets.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/wildbond.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/warwise.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/iconcraft.html","sigil-of-uchma/character-branches/attuner.html","sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Resting_and_Sleeping_0","sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&-weapons.html#Armor Types and Armor Rating","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Movement","sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&-weapons.html#Weapon Sets","sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html#Precision Rolls","sigil-of-uchma/content/skills.html","?query=tag:TODO","sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html","sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Encumbrance_0","sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html#Use Item","sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&-weapons.html#Armor Types and Armor Rating","sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&-weapons.html#Weapon Sets"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1763793893434,"modifiedTime":1770118862603,"sourceSize":10298,"sourcePath":"sigil-of-uchma/Content/Player Characters.md","exportPath":"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":14,"backlinks":["sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html","sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html","sigil-of-uchma/introduction.html","sigil-of-uchma/monsters/introduction-to-monsters.html","sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html"],"type":"markdown"},"sigil-of-uchma/content/skills.html":{"title":"Skills","icon":"","description":"Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character, such as being able to hunt more efficiently or identify a plant.

Bonuses or penalties from weapons, such as to resistance or armor only apply when you are currently wielding them.Some abilities may include a phrase similar to \"doing a basic weapon attack\". This means using the regular attack of a weapon, which is almost always the first active ability. Projectile attacks of some ranged weapons suffer a penalty to their precision rolls if the shooter moves during the same turn. The severity of the penalty varies by weapon.As long as there no adjacent foes, the attacker can negate these penalties by spending their movement to steady their aim.Some objects can be used as de facto weapons, at the GM's discretion.

The name is a reference to historical usage of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)\" target=\"_self\">Nazar amulets</a>, and it can be abbreviated simply as \"Sigil\".The game is played with one game master (GM) and one or more players:\nThe GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Each player controls a single player character (PC). Through their characters, players can explore the world, battle enemies, interact with NPCs, pursue and complete quests, find treasures and go on adventures.\nFurthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.In addition, there are various rules for exploration, inventory management, crafting, travelling, interactions with NPCs and other similar activities. Such activities have simple rules, and most of the moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.Sigil is not ready for full campaigns yet. You are seeing the version v1-a10 (alpha).<br>Sigil is a d10-based, combat-focused game with a simple action economy. While <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Combat\" data-href=\"Combat\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/combat.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">combat encounters</a> are the primary way of resolving conflicts, there are plenty of nonviolent challenges and opportunities handled by skills.<br>Each <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters\" data-href=\"Player Characters\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">player character</a> consists of many unique and interesting choices: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Weapons\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Weapons\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Weapons\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">weapons</a> provide both active and passive abilities, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Armor\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Armor\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Armor\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">armors</a> are strong, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Techniques\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Techniques\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Techniques\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">techniques</a> carry an impact while not being overpowered, and the two <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Aptitudes\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Aptitudes\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Aptitudes\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">aptitudes</a> allow players to fine tune how these abilities scale. Also, there are rarely any limitations: a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Path of Guides\" data-href=\"Path of Guides\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-guides.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Guide</a> or a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Path of Sorcerers\" data-href=\"Path of Sorcerers\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/character-paths/path-of-sorcerers.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sorcerer</a> can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.<br>During their adventures, the party might come across and fight <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Introduction to Monsters\" data-href=\"Introduction to Monsters\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/monsters/introduction-to-monsters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">monsters</a> such as charming snake-women, tickling sheep-men, elemental spirits as protectors of the nature or owl-vampires. In combat, a player character can use actions granted by their <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Weapons\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Weapons\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Weapons\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">weapons</a>, or the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Common Actions\" data-href=\"Common Actions\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/common-actions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">common actions</a> available to every character, to attack their foes. Should regular offence not be sufficient, the characters also have <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Techniques\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Techniques\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Techniques\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">techniques</a> (and class abilities) granted by their <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Classes\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Classes\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Classes\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Paths</a>, their main background in life, and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Classes\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Classes\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Classes\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Branches</a>, their secondary expertise. A character's Path also defines their health.<br>They can also endure the offence of enemies through negating it with their innate <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Player Characters &gt; Resistances\" data-href=\"Player Characters#Resistances\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/content/player-characters.html#Resistances\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">resistances</a> or mitigating it through equipment such as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Armor &amp; Weapons &gt; Armor\" data-href=\"Armor &amp; Weapons#Armor\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/armor-&amp;-weapons.html#Armor\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">armor</a> and defensive <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Weapons - Off Hand\" data-href=\"Weapons - Off Hand\" href=\"sigil-of-uchma/equipment/weapons-off-hand.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">off-hand weapons</a>, or taking it and keeping on fighting with their health pool. Using the right technique at the right time can provide an edge in combat.

A steady rhythm can lift allies’ spirits, while sharp dissonance can distract, weaken, or wound foes. Most of them are travelling storytellers and chroniclers, but an alternate path lies with the Ashik: religious poets who travel in service of a divinity, reflecting that god’s nature in their songs.Your base health is 70.Choose a creature within 3 meters at the start of your turn. This creature can take one action this turn instead of you. You are still able to use your minor action normally.You can upkeep your magical songs and poems to affect allies or foes. Songs and poems can be started with a speak common action used with an action or a rapid action and you can keep them up freely as long as you keep speaking each round in your turns.Some songs and poems require precision rolls. In this case, you only need to roll once per creature unless they were unable to hear your performance at any point. In this case, you need to roll for that creature again. You can only have one song or poem active at any time and you are unable to speak while singing. If your target gets out of range or you become unable to sing in any way, your upkeep ends. You can also end your song or poem freely at any time.By spending 1 energy during your turns, you can say a few words as part of a speak common action used for starting or upkeeping a song or a poem. You can't whisper when using this ability. By spending 2 energy during your turns, you can use both a rapid action and a prepared action. When you start a new song or poem, you can spend 1 energy to apply regeneration to affected creatures for 1 round. An ally assists you with your singing. When you start singing a new song or a poem, an ally who can hear you can pay half the energy cost of that technique.By spending 1 energy at the start of your turn, you can use the speak common action for upkeeping your singing freely without needing an action or a rapid action. Using this ability ends your upkeep next turn.Category: Utility\nExecution Time: Special\nCost: 6 energy\nDuration: Up to 1 hour\nEffect\nSubjects of your song are perceived better-looking.

As long as you can both hear each other and you upkeep this song, the target creature needs to keep up with you by using speak common action as an action or a rapid action during their turns similar to your magical poetry ability.\nWhoever fails to upkeep first receives 15 magical damage and the duel ends.

This connection to the environment isn’t passive either: attuners must constantly journey across the world, uncovering the countless ways these elements manifest. Earth can be fertile or barren; metal is hard but malleable to many shapes; fire burns things to ashes but some worship it; water sustains life but has the power to flood entire cities; and nature is both nurturing and merciless.An attuner is always in harmony with the elements in their environments. Upon entering a different environment you become enveloped with the primary element in that area. Your harmony with an element lasts until the environment changes significantly.Each location corresponds to exactly one element.Earth\nEncompasses environments such as mountains, caves or underground.\nBenevolent status effect: surefooted (rounds)\nMalignant status effect: disoriented (rounds) Metal\nEncompasses environments such as settlements or large battlefields.\nBenevolent status effect: 5 temporary physical armor (rounds)\nMalignant status effect: electrified (hits)\nFire\nEncompasses environments such as deserts or volcanoes.\nBenevolent status effect: 5 temporary magical armor (rounds)\nMalignant status effect: burning (hits)\nWater\nEncompasses environments such as seas, rivers, beaches, rainy or snowy places.\nBenevolent status effect: predictive foresight (rounds)\nMalignant status effect: soaked (rounds)\nNature\nEncompasses environments such as woods, plains or forests.\nBenevolent status effect: regeneration (hits)\nMalignant status effect: diseased (hits)\nBy spending 1 energy when using an ability that uses the element you are enveloped in, you may invert your harmony, treating yourself as enveloped in the element it suppresses instead.\nEarth -&gt; Water\nMetal -&gt; Nature\nFire -&gt; Metal\nWater -&gt; Fire\nNature -&gt; Earth Category: Modification\nExecution Time: Special\nCost: 1 energy\nEffect\nYou can choose to activate this technique as a part of your cycle of suppression ability.\nInstead of inverting your harmony with the primary element in the environment, you can promote it with another element, treating yourself as enveloped in that element instead:\nEarth -&gt; Metal\nMetal -&gt; Water\nFire -&gt; Earth\nWater -&gt; Nature\nNature -&gt; Fire\nYou can't choose this technique as your first one.Category: Defense\nAgainst: Parry\nExecution Time: Rapid action\nCost: 2 energy\nDuration: (1 + C/2) rounds or hits\nEffect\nExterior of a creature you can touch becomes enhanced with the element you are enveloped in, granting it the matching benevolent status effect for the duration and applying immobilized for 1 round.Category: Utility\nAgainst: Evasion\nExecution Time: Action\nCost: 3 energy\nRange: 5 meters\nRadius: (2 + C/4) meters\nDuration: (2 + C/2) rounds\nEffect\nInfuse an area with the element you are enveloped in, creating an effect depending on the element:\nEarth: The ground starts shifting, waving and spiralling.
