## Choose Prey
As a rapid action, you can designate a visible creature within 25 meters as your prey. You always know the health of this creature, and as long as this creature is alive and within range, it stays as your prey. 

You can only have one prey at a time. Changing your designation to another creature while you already have a prey costs 2 energy.
