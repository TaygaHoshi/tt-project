# Focusing on the Big Picture
Tacticians concern themselves not with the foe in front of them, but the whole battlefield. 

## Battle Overseer
You can keep the whole battlefield in your mind as a mental image:
1. You can't be ambushed by non-magical means. You can take the Speak special action to alert your allies, ending their ambushed status. 
2. As long as you clearly hear or see a creature once, you can track their location within a 50 meter radius.
