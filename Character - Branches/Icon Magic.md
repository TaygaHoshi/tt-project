# Icons, Symbols and Totems
Any object or place of immense power can be considered an icon: be it an eternal fireplace, a ceremonial weapon, a runestone or a mighty beast. Practicers of this type of magic are followers of their icon and they use symbolic manifestations of it to perform techniques called "rituals". 

## Totem
Choose an icon when you take this branch. You receive a small object representing it in return, called a totem. You can recall your totem to yourself as an action. A totem can be partially or fully destroyed, making it lose its powers. A destroyed totem magically restores itself within at most 12 hours depending on the degree of damage it suffered. Your totem can be used in a variety of ways:
1. You can perform rituals originating from yourself or your totem.
2. If you hold your totem like a weapon in either hand, you can have a ritual of your choice in a one meter radius around you by spending 1 energy per round. This ability ends if you stop holding your totem.
3. You can tap into your icon's power through your totem as a full-turn action, halving the cost of the next ritual you perform, down to a minimum of 1 energy.

## Source of Power
If you are in the vicinity of your icon, your totem stops functioning. Instead, you can receive power from your icon directly:
1. Your rituals originate from your icon.
2. Your rituals cost no energy to cast.

## Ritual Casting
Rituals of icon magic are techniques with two special properties:
1. You can have at most one ritual active at any time, and you can stop your rituals freely.
2. Your rituals do not affect you, and creatures carrying totems of your icon, unless specified otherwise.
