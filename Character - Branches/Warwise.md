# Focusing on the Big Picture
The Warwise concern themselves not with the foe in front of them, but the whole battlefield. 

## Battle Overseer
You can keep the whole battlefield in your mind as a mental image:
1. You can't be ambushed by non-magical means. You can take the Speak special action to alert your allies, ending their ambushed status. 
2. As long as you clearly hear or see a creature once, you can track their location within a 25 meter radius for up to 1 hour from the last time you hear or see it.

## Backup Plan
You can use this ability as a part of a damaging weapon attack by spending 1 energy. If you fail all of the precision rolls of this attack, you can instead use a non-damaging ability in its place.
