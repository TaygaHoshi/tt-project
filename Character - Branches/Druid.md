# Magicians of the World 
Druids are not just "tree magicians" or "wild magicians", a powerful druid has control over each of the five elements the material world offers: earth, metal, fire, water and, of course, nature. This connection to the environment isnâ€™t passive either: druids must constantly journey across the world, uncovering the countless ways these elements manifest. Earth can be fertile or barren; metal is hard but malleable to many shapes; fire scares animals but some tribes worship it; water sustains life but has the power to flood entire cities; and nature is both nurturing and merciless.

## Element-enveloped
A druid is always in harmony with the elements in their environment. When a druid spends more than an hour in an environment, they receive one of the following effects depending on where they are:
1. *Earth:* Mountains, caves or underground. +1 bonus to Warding and Constitution.
2. *Metal:* Settlements or large battlefields. (3 + P/3) bonus to physical damage, once per turn.
3. *Fire:* Deserts or volcanoes. (3 + P/3) bonus to magical damage, once per turn.
4. *Water:* Sea, rivers, rainy or snowy places. +1 bonus to Parry and Evasion.
5. *Nature:* Woods, plains or forests. +1 bonus to precision rolls for druid techniques. 

Each place corresponds to exactly one element, and an effect gained from this ability lasts until the environment changes significantly.

	A powerful arc of lightning leaves your hand and strikes your target, dealing 5 magical damage and applying electrified for the duration.

	Alternatively, you can choose to perform a wider and longer version of this technique. This requires 1 hour of uninterrupted casting. In this case, this rain cloud lasts for (2 + C/2) hours and affects a 50 meter radius area, which is considered a water environment for your element-enveloped ability.
