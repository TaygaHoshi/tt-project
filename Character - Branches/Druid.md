# Magicians of the World 
Druids are not just "tree magicians" or "wild magicians", a powerful druid has control over each of the five elements that composes the material world: earth, metal, fire, water and, of course, nature. This connection to the environment isn’t passive either: druids must constantly journey across the world, uncovering the countless ways these elements manifest. Earth can be fertile or barren; metal is hard but malleable to many shapes; fire burns things to ashes but some worship it; water sustains life but has the power to flood entire cities; and nature is both nurturing and merciless.

## Element-enveloped
A druid is always in harmony with the elements in their environments. Upon entering a different environment you become enveloped with the primary element in that area. Your harmony with an element lasts until the environment changes significantly.

Each location corresponds to exactly one element.

**Earth**
+ Encompasses environments such as mountains, caves or underground.
+ Benevolent status effect: surefooted (rounds)
+ Malignant status effect: disoriented (rounds) 

**Metal**
+ Encompasses environments such as settlements or large battlefields.
+ Benevolent status effect: 5 temporary physical armor (rounds)
+ Malignant status effect: electrified (hits)

**Fire**
+ Encompasses environments such as deserts or volcanoes.
+ Benevolent status effect: 5 temporary magical armor (rounds)
+ Malignant status effect: burning (hits)

**Water**
+ Encompasses environments such as seas, rivers, beaches, rainy or snowy places.
+ Benevolent status effect: predictive foresight (rounds)
+ Malignant status effect: soaked (rounds)

**Nature**
+ Encompasses environments such as woods, plains or forests.
+ Benevolent status effect: regeneration (hits)
+ Malignant status effect: diseased (hits)

## Cycle of Suppression
By spending 1 energy when using an ability that uses the element you are enveloped in, you may invert your harmony, treating yourself as enveloped in the element it suppresses instead.
- *Earth* -> Water
- *Metal* -> Nature
- *Fire* -> Metal
- *Water* -> Fire
- *Nature* -> Earth
