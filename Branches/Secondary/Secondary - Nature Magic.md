## Branch Armor
**Category:** Defense
**Execution Time:** Rapid action
**Cost:** 2 energy
**Range:** 1 meter
**Duration:** (1 + C/2) rounds
**Effect**
	This technique's precision roll is made against Evasion.
	A creature you can touch becomes covered with thick magical branches, which grant (5 + P/2) temporary physical armor. Alternatively, you can spend double energy and grant double the temporary armor. When this temporary armor breaks, the branches wither and the technique ends. 
	This creature is immobilized and can't do weapon attacks while this technique is active.
	This armor can be dismissed by you freely.

## Growth
**Category:** Utility
**Execution Time:** 1 hour
**Cost:** 6 energy
**Radius:** (50 + 5 x P) meters
**Duration:** (7 + C) days
**Effect**
	You spread your powers wide; improving, curing and growing nearby plants slightly. Plant creatures within radius gain 5 temporary physical armor for the duration. 

## Landshape
**Category:** Utility
**Execution Time:** Full-turn action
**Cost:** 4 energy
**Radius:** (3 + P/2) meters
**Duration:** (2 + C/2) hours
**Effect**
	You can vaguely guide the natural features of the geography around you to change shape. After half of this technique's duration has passed, the geography starts slowly returning to its original shape. While performing this technique, you can choose to spend double the energy cost instead. In this case, the technique requires 1 hour of uninterrupted casting but its effects stay permanent.  

## Minor Earthquake
**Category:** Offense
**Execution Time:** 5 minutes
**Cost:** 4 energy
**Radius:** (20 + P) meters
**Effect**
	 Create an earthquake centered around you, making every non-flying creature within radius fall prone without precision rolls. Small structures and similar constructs within radius, depending on their strength, become destroyed or damaged.

## Rain
**Category:** Utility
**Execution Time:** Full-turn action
**Cost:** 4 energy
**Range:** Self
**Radius:** 5 meters
**Duration:** (2 + C/2) rounds
**Effect**
	You generate a large and stationary rain cloud above you, and it starts to rain immediately. All creatures ending their turns below this cloud are soaked unless they have cover from rain.
	Alternatively, you can choose to perform a wider and longer version of this technique. This requires 1 hour of uninterrupted casting. In this case, this rain cloud lasts for 5 hours and affects a 50 meter radius area.
	This technique can only be used outside or interiors with sufficient space.

## Sprout
**Category:** Offense
**Execution Time:** Action 
**Cost:** 2 energy
**Range:** 1 meter 
**Radius:** (2 + C/2) meters
**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Effect**
	You grow a stationary and autonomous plant, which shoots needles to your foes within radius, right after your turn. It can shoot one needle per round, applying bleeding for 2 hit if it hits.
	This plant inherits your aptitudes. It has 10 health, and its resistances are equal to 5. 
	A sprout created by this technique is immune to debilitating status effects.
	Sprouts you create do not count towards your summon limit, and you can have up to (1 + P/2) sprouts at any time.
