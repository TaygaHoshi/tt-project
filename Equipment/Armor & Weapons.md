## Temporary Armor
Additional armor can be gained through spells and abilities which grant temporary armor. Rules of temporary armor can be found in the [[Status Effects]] page.

# Weapons
Weapons are what creatures use to hit their foes. Most creatures with body parts similar to arms and hands can use every weapon. There are several categories of weapons. Each of these can be found in their respective list:

1. [[Weapons - One Handed|One Handed weapons]] 
2. [[Weapons - Off Hand|Off-hand weapons]] 
3. [[Weapons - Two Handed|Two handed weapons]] 

## Basic Weapon Attacks
Some abilities may include a phrase similar to "doing a basic weapon attack". This means using the regular attack of a weapon, which is almost always the first active ability. 

## Weapon Sets
Weapon sets are helpful guides used primarily during character creation. If you take a bow, you will also get a quiver and 30 basic arrows/bolts. If you choose the throwing spear, you can take up to five spears. Extra spears take up space and require a quiver. A weapon set is any of these:
1. A one handed weapon and an off-hand weapon.
2. A one handed weapon and a light one handed weapon.
3. A two handed weapon.
