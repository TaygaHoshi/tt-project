# One Handed Weapons
One handed weapons are divided into two: heavy weapons and light weapons. Light weapons can be wielded as an off-hand weapon. When you wield a light weapon with your off-hand, you can only use its prepared action. Conversely, prepared actions of light weapons can't be used while they are wielded with the main hand.
