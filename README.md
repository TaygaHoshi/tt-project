Tayga's Tabletop Project (placeholder name) is a work-in-progress tabletop role playing game being created by me, [TaygaHoshi](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi). The game is currently in alpha stage.

You can start reading the rules from [this website](https://taygahoshi.github.io/tt-project/games/tt-project/introduction.html).

You can send me feedback from this form: https://forms.gle/7NwTYqGUWpBfBWNg8

This repository is for keeping track of changes to the game rules between versions. It may or may not be up to date. Playable books will be posted in the releases page after they are made publicly available.

# Playing the game
Currently, the game is in alpha state. This means it is not ready for running campaigns yet. When the first full version is released, it will be in the releases page of this repository. 

If you want to play the game anyway, I recommend sticking to one version and only updating if the newer version doesn't break the balance of the campaign.

# Contributing

You can contribute to most of the places labeled with "#TODO".
