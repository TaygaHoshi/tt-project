Tayga's Tabletop Project (placeholder name) is a work-in-progress tabletop role playing game being created by me, [TaygaHoshi](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi). 

Start reading at [INTRODUCTION.md](INTRODUCTION.md) for theme, goals and more. Since Github's markdown syntax is different from what I use, I recommend using the "code" view instead of the "preview" view to read the files.

This repository is for keeping track of changes to the game rules between versions. 
This repository may or may not be up to date. Playable books will be posted in the releases page after they are made publicly available.

# Playing the game
Currently, the game is not in a playable state. When a usable version is released, it will be in the releases page.

However feel free to play it from these notes if you want. You can also convert these notes into your own e-rulebook if you like books.

# Contributing
Feel free to submit a PR, but you must read [INTRODUCTION.md](INTRODUCTION.md) and [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit of these notes. You can simply fork this repo.
Then clone your fork into Obsidian or any equivalent software:
```bash
cd /path/to/obsidian/vault
git clone your-fork
```

# Formatting
1. All links between the files in this repository must be formatted like this -> [[INTRODUCTION]]. 
2. Newlines *should not* have empty lines between them in Obsidian. 
3. Paragraphs *should* have empty lines between them in Obsidian.

The only exception to the rules above is this README.md file.
