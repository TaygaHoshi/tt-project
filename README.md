Sigil of Uchma (formerly TT Project) is a work-in-progress tabletop role playing game being created by me, [TaygaHoshi](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi). The game is currently in alpha stage.

You can start reading the rules from [this website](https://taygahoshi.github.io/tt-project/games/tt-project/introduction.html).

You can send me feedback from this form: https://forms.gle/7NwTYqGUWpBfBWNg8

This repository is for keeping track of changes to the game rules between versions. It may or may not be up to date. Playable books will be posted in the releases page after they are made publicly available.
