At the start of a round, you can sacrifice 5 health to gain 10 temporary health for that round. This effect is clearly visible to other creatures.

## Blood is Power
As a rapid action, you can sacrifice 5 health to increase your aptitudes in one of the following ways, until the end of this round:
1. Increase either potency or control by 2, or
2. Increase both by 1 each.

## Death's Edge
When you are at or below 15 health and use an ability that costs health, you can instead spend 1 energy per 5 health cost to use that ability.

## Hand of the Underworld
Target a creature as a full-turn action and make a precision roll against their Constitution. This will alert the creature to your location. 
If you succeed, sacrifice up to 30 health. This creature takes armor-ignoring damage equal to the amount of health you sacrificed.
