# A Dark Source for Power
Not all shamans are as benevolent as the guides. As shamans of the Underworld, sorcerers are primarily concerned with powers from the lowest layer of existence, where only chaos and death can be found.

## Low Base Health
Your base health is 60.

## Boon of Underworld
Whenever you fail a precision roll, you can sacrifice 5 health to increase the result of that roll by one. You can do this multiple times per failed roll.

In addition, whenever you spend any amount of energy, you are healed for that amount.

## Equivalent Exchange
As a rapid action, you can sacrifice 5 health to gain 10 temporary health for that round. This effect is clearly visible to other creatures.

## Blood is Power
As a rapid action, you can sacrifice 5 health to increase your aptitudes in one of the following ways, until the end of this round:
1. Increase either potency or control by 2, or
2. Increase both by 1 each.

## Death's Edge
When you are at or below 15 health and use an ability that costs or sacrifices health, you can instead spend 1 energy per 5 health cost to use that ability.

## Hand of the Underworld
Target a creature as a full-turn action and make a precision roll against their Constitution. This will alert the creature to your location. 
If you succeed, sacrifice up to 30 health. This creature takes armor-ignoring damage equal to the amount of health you sacrificed. 
This ability does not get any bonuses to its damage.
