## Low Base Health
Your base health is 60.

## Boon of Underworld
Whenever you fail a precision roll, you can sacrifice 5 health to increase that roll by one. You can do this multiple times per failed roll.

In addition, whenever you spend any amount of energy, you are healed for that amount.

## Equivalent Exchange
At the start of a round, you can sacrifice 5 health to gain 10 temporary health for that round. This effect is clearly visible to other creatures.

## Blood is Power
As a rapid action, you can sacrifice 5 health to increase your aptitudes in one of the following ways:
1. Increase either potency or control by 2, or
2. Increase both by 1 each.

## Death's Edge
When you are below 15 health and use an ability that costs health, you can instead spend 1 energy per 5 health cost to use that ability.
