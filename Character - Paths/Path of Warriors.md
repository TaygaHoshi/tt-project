# Masters of Weaponry
Many professions require extensive training with weapons and armor: professional soldiers, bounty hunters, raiders and more. Some of them are lone wolves who rely only on brute force, some know a difficult task requires strong allies and some can even use magic. However, they have one common trait: they are very skilled when it comes to down to combat.
