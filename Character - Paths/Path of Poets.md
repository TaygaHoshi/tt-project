## Medium Base Health
Your base health is 70.

## Echo
Choose a creature within 3 meters at the start of your turn. This creature can take one action this turn instead of you. 

You are still able to use your minor action normally.

## Magical Poetry
You can upkeep your magical songs and poems to affect allies or foes. Songs and poems can be started with a *speak* special action used with an action or a rapid action and you can keep them up freely as long as you keep speaking each round in your turns.

Some songs and poems require precision rolls. In this case, you only need to roll once per creature unless they were unable to hear your performance at any point. In this case, you need to roll for that creature again. 

You can only have one song or poem active at any time and you are unable to speak while singing. If your target gets out of range or you become unable to sing in any way, your upkeep ends. You can also end your song or poem freely at any time.

## Insert Lyrics
By spending 1 energy during your turns, you can say a few words as part of a *speak* special action used for starting or upkeeping a song or a poem. You can't whisper when using this ability.  

## In Rhythm
By spending 2 energy during your turns, you can use both a rapid action and a prepared action. 

## Resonance
When you start a new song or poem, you can spend 1 energy to apply regeneration to affected creatures for 1 round. 

## Duet
An ally assists you with your singing. When you start singing a new song or a poem, an ally who can hear you can pay half the energy cost of that technique.

## Fade Out
By spending 1 energy at the start of your turn, you can use the *speak* special action for upkeeping your singing freely without needing an action or a rapid action. Using this ability ends your upkeep next turn.
