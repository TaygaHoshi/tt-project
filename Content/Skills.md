# Character Skills
Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character, such as being able to hunt more efficiently or identify a plant. At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll of a specific skill against a success threshold from a player. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: 
+ 1d10 + C/2 + other bonuses

Similar to resistances, you can choose to focus on two skills at first level as your major skills. Your major skills use a different formula:
- 2d10 + C/2 + other bonuses
