# Character Skills
Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character, such as being able to hunt more efficiently or identify a plant. 

At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll against a success threshold from a player. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: 
+ 1d10 + skill value + bonuses

Characters gain a set amount of skill points on each level up, and they gain an additional point for every two aptitude points spent on *control*. A character can earn 20 SP from gaining levels and up to 5 SP from their *control* aptitude. This means a character can have up to 25 SP in total. These points can be spent on a skill to increase its value by one. A skill can be increased only once per level. 

Points gained per level are given in this table:

| Level | Gained SP |
| :---: | :-------: |
|   1   |    +2     |
|   2   |    +2     |
|   3   |    +2     |
|   4   |    +2     |
|   5   |    +2     |
|   6   |    +2     |
|   7   |    +2     |
|   8   |    +2     |
|   9   |    +2     |
|  10   |    +2     |
