# Skills
Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character. Each skill is about a certain set of actions or abilities. Skills are improved by spending skill points. At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll from a player. This can be because of something the player wants to do, an environmental effect or something else. While the GM can freely determine the success threshold, a list of sample success thresholds for common situations will be given. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: 
	1d10 + skill value + bonuses

Players gain a set amount of Skill Points (SP) on each level up. SPs can be spent on a skill to increase its value by one. A skill can be increased only once per level. A total of 22 SP can be earned. SPs gained per level are given in this table:
```skill_table
lvl | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10
sp  |+4|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2
```

Furthermore, some skills are grouped under an aptitude. A class or a branch may grant a "main skill aptitude" to a character. When this character makes a skill roll with a skill under their main skill aptitude, the roll is instead:
	1d10 + skill value + relevant aptitude + bonuses
