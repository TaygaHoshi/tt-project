# Skills
Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character. Each skill is about a certain set of actions or abilities. Skills are improved by spending skill points. At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll from a player. This can be because of something the player wants to do, an environmental effect or something else. While the GM can freely determine the success threshold, a list of sample success thresholds for common situations will be given. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: 
+ 1d10 + skill value + bonuses

Players gain a set amount of skill points on each level up. These points can be spent on a skill to increase its value by one. A skill can be increased only once per level. A total of 22 SP can be earned. Points gained per level are given in this table:

| Level | Gained SP |
| :---: | :-------: |
|   1   |    +4     |
|   2   |    +2     |
|   3   |    +2     |
|   4   |    +2     |
|   5   |    +2     |
