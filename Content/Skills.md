# Skills
Skills are miscellaneous abilities of a character. Each skill is about a certain set of actions or abilities. Skills are improved by spending skill points. Furthermore, some skills are grouped under an aptitude. A class or a branch may grant a "main skill aptitude" to a character. When a character spends a skill point in one of the skills in their main skill aptitude, that skill is increased by two instead of increasing by one.

At any point, the GM might ask for a skill roll from a player. This can be because of something the player wants to do, an environmental effect or something else. When making a skill roll, the following formula is used: 
	1d10 + skill value + bonuses

While the GM can freely determine the success threshold, a list of sample success thresholds for common situations will be supplied.

Players gain a set amount of Skill Points (SP) on each level up. A skill can be increased only once per level. A total of 22 SP can be earned. SPs gained per level are given in this table:
```skill_table
lvl | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10
sp  |+4|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2|+2
```
