# Aptitudes
Aptitudes are main traits of a character which take values between 0 and 10. There are five aptitudes: Strength, Endurance, Witchcraft, Social and Divine. Players gain a set amount of Aptitude Points (AP) on each level up. An aptitude can't be larger than the character's total level. Each aptitude is further divided into two stats: a potency stat and a control stat, respectively. Aptitude points are spent on those stats.

The table below shows the aptitudes, their potency stats and their precision stats.

| Aptitude   | Potency        | Control          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Strength   | Power (POW)    | Dexterity (DEX)  |
| Endurance  | Vitality (VIT) | Speed (SPD)      |
| Witchcraft | Arcane (ARC)   | Harmony (HAR)    |
| Divine     | Faith (FAI)    | Clarity (CLA)    |
| Social     | Presence (PRE) | Accordance (ACC) |

A total of 25 AP can be earned. Points gained per level are given in this table:

# Resistances
Resistances lower the accuracy of incoming hits. They act as the success thresholds of precision rolls. List of resistances is given below:

| Resistance | Counters |
| :--: | :--- |
| Parry | Strength rolls |
| Constitution | Status effects (usually) |
| Evasion | Area of effect attacks (usually) |
| Reflection | Witchcraft rolls |
| Favor | Divine rolls |
| Willpower | Social rolls |

Resistances are determined by stats, equipment, and other various things. At level 1, you can choose to focus on certain resistances:
1. You can choose one resistance to be "major" and another one to be "minor".
2. Alternatively, you can choose three resistances to be "minor".

Resistance choices affect their scaling:

| Level  | Major | Minor | Neither |
| :----: | :---- | ----- | ------- |
| **1**  | 7     | 6     | 5       |
| **2**  | 7     | 6     | 5       |
| **3**  | 8     | 7     | 6       |
| **4**  | 8     | 7     | 6       |
| **5**  | 9     | 8     | 7       |
| **6**  | 9     | 8     | 7       |
| **7**  | 10    | 9     | 8       |
| **8**  | 10    | 9     | 8       |
| **9**  | 11    | 10    | 9       |
| **10** | 11    | 10    | 9       |
