# Aptitudes
Aptitudes are main traits of a character which take values between 0 and 10. There are five aptitudes: Strength, Endurance, Witchcraft, Social and Divine. Players gain a set amount of Aptitude Points (AP) on each level up. An aptitude can't be larger than the character's total level. Each aptitude is further divided into two stats: a potency stat and a precision stat, respectively. Aptitude points are spent on those stats.

The table below shows the aptitudes, their potency stats and their precision stats.

Aptitude | Potency | Precision
--- | --- | ---
Strength | Power (POW) | Accuracy (ACU)
Endurance | Vitality (VIT) | Speed (SPD)
Witchcraft | Arcane (ARC) | Penetration (PEN)
Divine | Wrath (WRA) | Praying (PRA)
Social | Expression (EXP) | Persuading (PER)

A total of 23 AP can be earned. Points gained per level are given in this table:

# Resistances
Resistances lower the accuracy of incoming hits. They act as the success thresholds of precision rolls. Resistances are determined by stats, equipment, class and other various things.

+ Resistances are calculated with the following formula:
	* 6 + (total level)/2 + (potency of relevant aptitude)/3 + other bonuses


+ Each class gets to choose a main resistance. Main resistance of a character is calculated separately using the following formula:
	* 6 + (total level)/2 + (potency of relevant aptitude)/2 + other bonuses

List of resistances is given below:

**Parry**
+ Counters ACU rolls.
+ Increases with POW.

**Constitution**
+ Usually counters attacks that give status effects.
