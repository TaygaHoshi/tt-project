# Player Characters
Player characters are the other part, alongside the Game Master, of Sigil of Uchma. This page will go over the basics of character creation.

## Guide to Character Creation

![[Sigil of Uchma v1-a6 Character Creation Guide.pdf]]

## Classes
A player character can start with choosing a class:
1. [[Soldier]]
2. [[Shaman]]
3. [[Scout]]
4. [[Magician]]
5. [[Warden]]
6. [[Performer]]

Classes are further divided into subclasses called branches. Description of branches will be added to the relevant class page. Currently, branches are #TODO.

### Health
Your starting class determines your health. There are three tiers of maximum health:

Tier | Value
--- | :---:
High   | 80 health
Medium | 70 health
Low    | 60 health

### Energy
Your starting class determines your energy, which is used for casting spells or performing combat techniques. There are three tiers of maximum energy, scaling differently as you gain levels:

Tier | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
High   | 8|10|12|14|16|18|20|22|24|24|
Medium | 6| 6| 9| 9|12|12|15|15|18|18|
Low    | 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|12|


### Spells and Combat Techniques
Spell casters can use spells while classes like soldier and scout can use combat techniques. These abilities usually cost energy to activate. They are explained in more detail within their respective pages: [[Spells]] and [[Combat Techniques]].

## Aptitudes
Aptitudes are the main traits of a character. They are explained in the [[Aptitudes]] page.

## Starter Equipment
Each player character can choose a starting equipment from choices given by their class, branch and backstory. Most commonly: 
+ [[Weapons]]
+ [[Armor]]
+ [[Items, Crafting and Inventory Management]]

## Walking Speed

# Character Mechanics
## Resting and Sleeping
Usually, a character requires 6 to 8 hours of sleep per day. Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.

There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:
1. Be able to sit or lie down. 
2. Be relaxed.
3. Be in a safe environment.

Sleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:
1. They have a place to sleep.
2. They are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.

Resting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:
1. Characters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping.
2. Similarly, 2 points of energy regenerates per hour while sleeping.
3. While only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.

However, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.
