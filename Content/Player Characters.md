# Player Characters
Player characters are the other part, alongside the Game Master, of Sigil of Uchma. This page will go over the basics of character creation.

# Character Creation
### Paths
Paths determine a characters' abilities gained through leveling up and half of their techniques. Current list of paths are:
- [[Path of Warriors]]
- [[Path of Sorcerers]]
- [[Path of Shamans]]
- [[Path of Bards]]

### Branches
Paths determine a characters' branch abilities and half of their techniques. Current list of branches are:
- [[Underworld Magic]]
- [[Tactics]]
- [[Legend Calling]]
- [[Idol Magic]]
- [[Druid Magic]]
- [[Beast Taming]]

### Aptitudes
A player character gains one aptitude point each level starting from level 1. Aptitude points can be spent on either Potency (P) or Control (C):
+ Potency (P) usually increases the strength of abilities, meanwhile
+ Control (C) usually increases the duration and size of abilities.

### Health
Your path determines your base health. There are three tiers of maximum health:

| Tier   | Base Health |
| ------ | :---------: |
| High   |  80 health  |
| Medium |  70 health  |
| Low    |  60 health  |
### Energy
Energy is used for performing techniques and other abilities. As your character levels up, your base energy increases:

| Level  | Base Energy |
| :----: | :---------: |
| **1**  |      8      |
| **2**  |     10      |
| **3**  |     12      |
| **4**  |     14      |
| **5**  |     16      |
| **6**  |     18      |
| **7**  |     20      |
| **8**  |     22      |
| **9**  |     24      |
| **10** |     24      |

### Resistance
Resistances lower the accuracy of incoming hits. They act as the success thresholds of precision rolls. List of resistances is given below:

|  Resistance  | Used Against           |
| :----------: | :--------------------- |
|    Parry     | Physical attacks       |
|   Warding    | Magical attacks        |
| Constitution | Status effects         |
|   Evasion    | Area of effect attacks |

If an ability doesn't specify what resistance it is used against, it will either use Parry or Warding depending whether or not it is a magical ability.

Resistances are determined by stats, equipment, and other various things. At level 1, you can choose to focus on certain resistances:
1. You can choose one resistance to be "major" and another one to be "minor".
2. Alternatively, you can choose three resistances to be "minor".

Resistance choices affect their scaling:

| Level  | Major | Minor | Neither |
| :----: | :---- | ----- | ------- |
| **1**  | 7     | 6     | 5       |
| **2**  | 7     | 6     | 5       |
| **3**  | 8     | 7     | 6       |
| **4**  | 8     | 7     | 6       |
| **5**  | 9     | 8     | 7       |
| **6**  | 9     | 8     | 7       |
| **7**  | 10    | 9     | 8       |
| **8**  | 10    | 9     | 8       |
| **9**  | 11    | 10    | 9       |
| **10** | 11    | 10    | 9       |

## Techniques
Techniques are special abilities which usually cost energy to activate. A player character can choose a technique from their path every even level, and from their branch every odd level:

| Level  | Path Techniques | Branch Techniques |
| :----: | :-------------: | :---------------: |
| **1**  |        1        |         1         |
| **2**  |        2        |         1         |
| **3**  |        2        |         2         |
| **4**  |        3        |         2         |
| **5**  |        3        |         3         |
| **6**  |        4        |         3         |
| **7**  |        4        |         4         |
| **8**  |        5        |         4         |
| **9**  |        5        |         5         |
| **10** |        5        |         5         |

## Resting and Sleeping
Usually, a character requires 6 to 8 hours of sleep per day. Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.

There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:
1. Be able to sit or lie down. 
2. Be relaxed.
3. Be in a safe environment.

Sleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:
1. They have a place to sleep.
2. They are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.

Resting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:
1. Characters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping, up to the their base health.
2. Similarly, 2 points of energy regenerates per hour while sleeping, up to the character's base energy.
3. While only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.

However, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.
