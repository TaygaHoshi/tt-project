# Character Creation
## Choosing a Class
A player character can start with choosing a class:
1. [[Soldier]]
2. [[Shaman]]
3. [[Scout]]
4. [[Magician]]
5. [[Warden]]
6. [[Performer]]

Classes are further divided into subclasses called branches. Description of branches will be added to the relevant class page. Currently, branches are #TODO.

## Health
Your starting class determines your health. There are three tiers of maximum health:
```health_table
Low    : 60 health
Medium : 70 health
High   : 80 health
```

## Mana and Stamina
For mana scaling, see: [[Spells]].
For stamina scaling, see: [[Combat Techniques]].

## Movement Speed and Initiative
See: [[List of Rules - Combat#Movement|Movement]] and [[Combat#Turn Order|Turn Order]].

## Choosing Aptitudes
See: [[Aptitudes]]

## Choosing Starter Equipment
Each player character can choose a starting equipment from choices given by their class, branch and backstory. Most commonly: 
+ [[Weapons]]
+ [[Armor]]
+ [[Items, Crafting and Inventory Management]]

# Character Mechanics
## Resting and Sleeping
Usually, a character requires 6 to 8 hours of sleep per day. Not getting proper sleep for a night gives a character one stack of fatigue. Skipping sleep while having 5 stacks of fatigue is lethal and the character dies. While it is usually the best to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. In this case, the GM can determine whether or not these activities are allowed as a part of resting.

There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping. For a character to be able to rest, they should:
1. Be able to sit or lie down. 
2. Be relaxed.
3. Be in a safe environment.

Sleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:
1. They have a place to sleep.
2. They are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.

Resting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:
1. Characters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping.
2. Similarly, 2 points of mana and stamina regenerates per hour while sleeping.
3. While only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.
4. In case a character has both mana and stamina, these rates are halved.
	1. While sleeping, these characters gain 1 point of mana and stamina per hour.
	2. While resting, they gain 1 point of mana and stamina per 2 hours of rest. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may allow these 2 hours to be non-consecutive.

However, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.
