Low    : 60 health
Medium : 70 health

# Character Mechanics
## Resting and Sleeping
Usually, a character requires 6 to 8 hours of sleep per day. While it is most optimal to sleep at night, it is not rare to see parties resting during the day. When the players decide the party should rest or sleep, they must declare this to the GM. In the case of just resting, the players should also explain what their characters will be doing while resting. There are a few basic requirements to resting and sleeping.

For a character to be able to rest, they should:
1. Be able to sit or lie down. 
2. Be relaxed.
3. Be in a safe environment.

Sleeping has stricter requirements. Alongside the resting requirements, a character can sleep only if:
1. They have a place to sleep.
2. They are wearing clothing, robes or light armor.

Resting and sleeping, normally, have the following benefits:
1. Characters heal 10 health per hour while sleeping.
2. Similarly, 2 points of mana and stamina regenerates per hour while sleeping.
3. While only resting, these regeneration rates are halved.

However, not all damage and status effects can be healed this way. What makes sense and what does not is left primarily to the GM.
