# Spells
Normally, magic and magical power is found all around the world of TT Project. Some can store this magic in their body as an energy called mana. Normally, mana can't be used for anything as it has no effect. Shaping mana into a form to fulfill a purpose gives it different effects, and this shape can be remembered. Magicians are those who learn and keep track of these forms.

Spells are, simply put, known shapes and forms of magic. Spells need to be trained like a soldier trains with a weapon, and casting one requires a similar amount of muscle memory to martial arts. Similar to stamina, a magician has a definite amount of mana in their body. Mana is gained passively from the environment while sleeping or resting.

Spells are split into three branches. Each of these can be found in their respective list:
1. Witchcraft Spells
2. Divine Spells
3. Social Spells

# Damaging Spells
For a spell to be considered a "damaging spell", it should have a base damage. Examples could be "Stone Blades", "Elemental Arrow" or "Dissonance". Some spells such as "Severing Mark" only apply a status effect, but do not have a base damage. These spells are not considered damaging spells.
