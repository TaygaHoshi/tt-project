# Spells
Normally, magic and magical power is found all around the world of Sigil of Uchma. Some can store this magic in their body as an energy called mana. Normally, mana can't be used for anything as it has no effect. Shaping mana into a form to fulfill a purpose gives it different effects, and this shape can be remembered. Magicians are those who learn and keep track of these forms.

Spells are, simply put, known shapes and forms of magic. Spells need to be trained like a soldier trains with a weapon, and casting one requires a similar amount of muscle memory to martial arts. Similar to stamina, a magician has a definite amount of mana in their body. Mana is gained passively from the environment while sleeping or resting.

Spells are split into three categories. Each of these can be found in their respective list:
1. [[List of Witchcraft Spells|Witchcraft Spells]]
2. [[List of Divine Spells|Divine Spells]]
3. [[List of Social Spells|Social Spells]]

Spells in each category are further divided into three groups: novice, veteran and expert. These three groups guide the spell learning progress. A similar mechanism exists on [[Combat Techniques]], albeit the names of the groups are different.

Lastly, a spell can be a complex spell or a simple spell. This mainly affects what kind of spells a character can learn. For example, the "magical specialization" ability of a Soldier only allows them to learn a simple novice spell. However, a Magician can learn both simple and complex witchcraft spells.

# Damaging Spells
For a spell to be considered a "damaging spell", it should have a base damage. Examples could be "Stone Blades", "Elemental Arrow" or "Dissonance". Some spells such as "Severing Mark" only apply a status effect, but do not have a base damage. These spells are not considered damaging spells.
