# Spells
Normally, magic and magical power is found all around the world of Sigil of Uchma. Some can expand their inner energy out as structured magic. Shaping energy into a form to fulfill a purpose gives it different effects, and this shape can be remembered. Spell casters such as Magician learn and keep track of these forms.

Spells are, simply put, known shapes and forms of magic. Spells need to be trained like a soldier trains with a weapon, and casting one requires a similar amount of muscle memory to martial arts. A spell caster has a definite amount of energy in their body. Energy is gained passively while sleeping or resting.

Spells are split into three categories. Each of these can be found in their respective list:
1. [[List of Spells - Witchcraft|Witchcraft Spells]]
2. [[List of Spells - Divine|Divine Spells]]
3. [[List of Spells - Social|Social Spells]]

Spells in each category are further divided into three groups: novice, veteran and expert. These three groups guide the spell learning progress. A similar mechanism exists on [[Combat Techniques]], albeit the names of the groups are different.

Lastly, a spell can be a complex spell or a simple spell. This mainly affects what kind of spells a character can learn. For example, the "magical specialization" ability of a Soldier only allows them to learn a simple novice spell. However, a Magician can learn both simple and complex witchcraft spells.
