# Combat Techniques
Warriors might not be able to cast spells like a magician or a shaman, but they can take on their enemies their own way: brute force, complex movement, advanced techniques and alternative uses of weapons. By default, all combat techniques use the strength aptitude.

There are two kinds of combat techniques: Simple and advanced. These two groups guide the combat technique learning progress. A similar mechanism exists on [[Spells]], albeit the names of the groups are different. 

Using combat techniques require some amount of energy. Each creature has a definite amount of energy in their body. Energy is gained passively while sleeping or resting.

A list of techniques can be found in the [[List of Combat Techniques]].
