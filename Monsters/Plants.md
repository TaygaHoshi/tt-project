They are trees which can grow up to between 5 and 10 meters tall. Thornbranches, sentient or not, produce a type of date called "thornbranch fruit". Sentient thornbranches are mostly passive and will not attack unprovoked. When provoked, however, they can be a tough opponent utilizing their namesake thorns to great effect.</td></tr>
