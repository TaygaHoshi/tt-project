## Sentient Thornbranch
+ **Lore:** Some plants can gain sentience due to various magical effects. Sentient thornbranches are prime examples of such plants. They are trees which can grow up to between 5 and 10 meters tall. Thornbranches, sentient or not, produce a type of date called "thornbranch fruit". Sentient thornbranches are mostly passive and will not attack unprovoked. When provoked, however, they can be a tough opponent utilizing their namesake thorns to great effect.
