# Movement
#TODO: Add explanations for movement within combat.

Movement speed of a creature is equal to:
	(base movement speed + other bonuses) meters/round

Base movement speed of a creature is calculated with the formula below:
	(10 + SPD) meters/round

## Walking
* Walking speed is equal to the default movement speed.

## Running
+ Instead of taking an action, a character might move twice. This is called "running" and unless specified, it is equal to double the walking speed.
+ A running character can't take actions, rapid actions or prepared actions.

## Flying

## Climbing

## Jumping

# Death
+ When a player character falls below 0 health, they are considered "unconscious".
+ An unconscious character is considered prone.
+ If a player character takes equal to or more than double their base maximum health, they die immediately.
+ At the end phase of each round, unconscious characters make a death save roll against increased thresholds:
	+ Death save rolls are calculated with this formula: (1d10 + VIT)
	+ 1st round: 3
	+ 2nd round: 5
	+ 3rd round: 7
	+ 4th round: 9
+ A character dies if they fail any of their death saves or when they reach their 5th consecutive round in unconscious state. 
+ If a character is healed to at least 1 health during unconscious state, they become conscious again and they are considered prone.

# Summoning
+ When a creature summons minions, as a part of the same action, they can give their summon simple orders. Some examples are given below:
	+ Attack this target
	+ Run back to me
	+ Take this action
	+ Go there
+ At the end phase of each turn, the summoner can give an order to their summons freely. 
+ Summoners must give these orders by shouting in a language of their choosing unless specified otherwise. A summon must be able to hear the summoner clearly. Any creatures in the vicinity can also understand the orders, if they know the language used. 
+ Summoners have a simple telepathic bond to their summons. A summoner will know where the summon is and how much damage it suffered at all times. 
+ The minions follow the regular initiative order:
	+ If the summons have equal or higher initiative than the summoner, they move immediately after the summoner during the round they are summoned. 
	+ If the summons have lower speed, they are placed in the turn order accordingly. This may mean a d20 roll may be necessary to solve conflicting turn orders. 

# Cover and Line of Sight
+ When a character is behind cover, they are semi-protected against projectile attacks or projectile spells.
+ There are 3 types of cover:
	+ Quarter Cover: +1 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.
	+ Half Cover: +2 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.
	+ Full Cover: +4 bonus to all resistances versus projectiles.
+ Having other creatures in the way while determining cover count as quarter cover. This doesn't increase with the amount of creatures in the way.
+ If a creature is completely blocked from another's point of view, they are out of line of sight and can't be interacted with targeted attacks and spells.
+ Abilities, spells and attacks which affect an area may require hearing or sight:
	+ Sounds can't pass rocks, deep water and similar materials.
	+ Sounds can pass 1 meter of wood, metal, shallow water and other similar materials.
	+ Cover of any kind doesn't break line of sight.
	+ Magical remote eyes and ears count as sight and hearing for the purposes of these kind of effects.
	+ There may be magical effects which can break line of sight or block sounds.

# Terrain Obstacles
#TODO 

+ Walking through other creatures:
	+ A creature can move through its allies. Each square passed in this way count as two squares. 

# Falling Prone
+ A creature can go into prone voluntarily if they give up half of their base movement speed as a part of their movement during their turn.
+ When a creature falls or goes prone, they have to be in movement phase of their turn and use half of their base movement speed to get up.
+ A prone creature has half cover against projectiles.
+ A prone creature has -2 to all resistances against attacks and spells used within melee range, including projectiles.
+ A prone creature can only do their basic weapon attack, dealing half damage and ignoring weapon precision.

# Fall Damage
+ A character takes fall damage when they fall more than 3 meters.
+ The damage from fall is armor-ignoring and it is calculated as such:
	+ Fall damage = 10 x (fall distance in meters - 3)

# Ambushes
When the party ambushes or gets ambushed by one or more foes, the ambushed side is considered disadvantageous and they receive the following effects for the first round of combat:
+ -2 penalty on SPD
+ -1 penalty on all precision rolls
+ -1 penalty on all resistances
