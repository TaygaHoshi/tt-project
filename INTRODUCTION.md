# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on a hypothetical medieval Central Asian society, based primarily on Gokturks and secondarily on other cultures within the area. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)).

It is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their PCs, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and more.

Sigil of Uchma is an alternate history fantasy game. This means we are not bound strictly by Turkic mythology and lifestyle from early middle age and before. Things can be added, changed and removed. I highly recommend reading the resources in the section below.

# Design Decisions & Features
**Fun and engaging turn-based combat:**
Each character consists of many unique but balanced choices: weapons provide both active and passive abilities, techniques carry an impact while not being overpowered, and armors are strong. Additionally there is no arbitrarily locking players out of features. A Shaman can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.

Furthermore, Sigil of Uchma is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.

**Uniquely themed items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:**
Sigil of Uchma has owl vampires, charming snake-humans, Central Asian spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.

**Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:**
Sigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Imagination can open up a lot of possibilities.

# Playing the game
Currently, the game is in alpha state. This means it is not ready for running campaigns yet. If you want to play the game anyway, I recommend sticking to one version and only updating if the newer version doesn't break the balance of the campaign.
