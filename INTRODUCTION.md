# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on mythologies of medieval Central Asian societies. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)). Sigil of Uchma can be abbreviated simply as "Sigil".

The game is played with one game master (GM) and one or more players:
- The GM builds and runs a campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). 
- Each player controls a single player character (PC). Through their PCs, players can explore the world, battle enemies, interact with NPCs, pursue and complete quests, find treasures and go on adventures.

Sigil is not ready for running campaigns yet. You are seeing the version: *v1-a9*.

# Features
**Fun and engaging turn-based combat:**
Each character consists of many unique but balanced choices: weapons provide both active and passive abilities, techniques carry an impact while not being overpowered, and armors are strong. There are rarely any limitations: a Shaman can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.

Furthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.

**Unique items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:**
This game has owl vampires, charming snake-humans, Central Asia themed spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.

**Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:**
Sigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Many cases of moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.
