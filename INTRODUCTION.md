# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on a hypothetical medieval Central Asian society, based primarily on Gokturks and secondarily on other cultures within the area. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)). Currently, the game is not ready for running campaigns yet.

Sigil of Uchma is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs a campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their characters, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and go on adventures.

Sigil of Uchma can be abbreviated simply as "Sigil".

# Features
**Fun and engaging turn-based combat:**
Each character consists of many unique but balanced choices: weapons provide both active and passive abilities, techniques carry an impact while not being overpowered, and armors are strong. There are only rarely limitations: a Shaman can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.

Furthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.

**Unique items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:**
This game has owl vampires, charming snake-humans, Central Asia themed spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.

**Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:**
Sigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, traveling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Many cases of moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.
