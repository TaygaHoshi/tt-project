# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game inspired by medieval Central Asian mythologies. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)), and it can be abbreviated simply as "Sigil".

The game is played with one game master (GM) and one or more players:
- The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). 
- Each player controls a single player character (PC). Through their characters, players can explore the world, battle enemies, interact with NPCs, pursue and complete quests, find treasures and go on adventures.

Each player character consists of many unique and interesting choices: weapons provide both active and passive abilities, techniques carry an impact while not being overpowered, and armors are strong. There are rarely any limitations: a Guide or a Sorcerer can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.

During your adventures you might come across and fight monsters such as charming snake-women, tickling sheep-men, elemental spirits as protectors of the nature or owl-vampires.

Furthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.

In addition, there are various rules for exploration, inventory management, crafting, travelling, interactions with NPCs and other similar activities. Such activities have simple rules, and most of the moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.

Sigil is not ready for full campaigns yet. You are seeing the version *v1-a10* (alpha).

# Where to Start
The bulk of the rules used within combat encounters are in [[Combat|the combat page]]. While it is a good place to dive into the game, you might want to start from [[Player Characters|the character creation page]] for a more gradual introduction. This step can be followed through via [the character creation website](https://sigil-create.tyghsh.cc).

From there, the natural follow-up is the set of pages that explain what a player character is made of:
- The pages under _Character - Paths_,
- The pages under _Character - Branches_,
- The [[Skills|character skills]] page.

Once you have a grasp on those, move on to the basic equipment for every player character: [[Armor & Weapons]].

Next pages to read would be the shared abilities and effects used across the game, in the pages describing [[Common Actions]] and [[Status Effects]].

Finally, if you want to learn about the various items to obtain and monsters you could meet during a campaign, check out the pages under the _Items_ category as well as [[Introduction to Monsters|the monsters page]].
