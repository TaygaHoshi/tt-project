# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma (formerly TT Project) is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on a hypothetical medieval Central Asian society, based primarily on Gokturks and secondarily on other cultures within the area. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)).

It is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their PCs, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and more.

Sigil of Uchma is an alternate history fantasy game. This means we are not bound strictly by Turkic mythology and lifestyle from early middle age and before. Things can be added, changed and removed. I highly recommend reading the resources in the section below.

# Design Decisions & Features
**A base rule set to build and play different types of campaigns:**
Rules in this game are trimmed before they are added. This makes Sigil of Uchma a good base to build campaigns upon.

**Uniquely themed items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters:**
Sigil of Uchma has owl vampires, charming snake monsters able to transform into a human form, Central Asian spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.

**Character creation full of meaningful choice:**
See [[Player Characters]].

**Fun and engaging turn-based combat:**
Classes have both shared and unique abilities. Weapons have active and passive abilities, spells are varied and carry an impact while not being overpowered, armors are strong. Additionally there is no arbitrarily locking players out of features. A magician can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties to their spell casting.

Furthermore, there are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get very fast.

**Soft mechanics and rules for role playing:**
Sigil of Uchma is a simplified take on modern TTRPGs. Exploration, inventory management, economy, travelling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. Imagination in these situations can open up a good amount of possibilities.

# Playing the game
Currently, the game is in alpha state. This means it is not ready for running campaigns yet. When the first full version is released, [it will be in the releases page of this repository](https://github.com/TaygaHoshi/tt-project/releases). 

If you want to play the game anyway, I recommend sticking to one version and only updating if the newer version doesn't break the balance of the campaign.
