# Introduction
Tayga's Tabletop Project (placeholder name) is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game based on a hypothetical medieval Central Asian society, based primarily on Gokturks and secondarily on other cultures within the area. The name Tayga's Tabletop Project can be shortened as TTP or TT Project.

It is played with a game master (GM) and one or more players. The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary, and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). Players, on the other hand, are responsible from their characters, which are called player characters (PCs). Each player is assumed to bring only one PC. With the use of their PCs, players can explore places, fight foes, deceive or help NPCs, take on quests, collect items and more.

# Reading Order
Unfortunately, putting things in a proper reading order like a book is difficult. Until then, I recommend following this order:
1. [[README]]
2. [[INTRODUCTION]]
3. [[Player Characters]]
4. [[Combat]]

# Features
**A base rule set to build and play different types of campaigns**
While no OSR, rules in this game are trimmed before they are added. This makes TT Project a good base to build campaigns upon.

**Uniquely themed items, skills, magic, NPCs and monsters.**
TT Project has owl vampires, charming snake monsters able to transform into a human form, Central Asian spells and rituals, interesting abilities and more.

**Character creation full of meaningful choice.**
See [[Player Characters]].
Additionally, see [[Classes]], [[Weapons]], [[Spells]], [[Combat Techniques]] and other content.

**Fun and engaging turn-based combat.**
Classes have both shared and unique abilities. Weapons have active and passive abilities, spells are varied and carry an impact while not being overpowered, armors are strong. Additionally there is no unnaturally locking players out of features. A magician can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties to their spell casting. 

Furthermore, there are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get very fast.

**Soft mechanics and rules for role playing**
Exploration, inventory management, economy, travelling, interactions with NPCs and similar activities mostly have only general rules and suggestions. While no OSR, imagination in these situations can open up a good amount of possibilities.

# Theme
TT Project is an alternate history fantasy game. This means we are not bound strictly by Turkic mythology and lifestyle from early middle age and before. Things can be added, changed and removed. I highly recommend reading the resources in the section below.
