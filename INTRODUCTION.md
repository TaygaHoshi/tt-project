# Introduction
Sigil of Uchma is a work-in-progress fantasy tabletop role playing game inspired by medieval Central Asian mythologies. The name is a reference to historical usage of [Nazar amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazar_(amulet)), and it can be abbreviated simply as "Sigil".

The game is played with one game master (GM) and one or more players:
- The GM builds and runs the campaign, enforces the rules of the game, applies or creates resolution mechanics as necessary and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). 
- Each player controls a single player character (PC). Through their characters, players can explore the world, battle enemies, interact with NPCs, pursue and complete quests, find treasures and go on adventures.

Furthermore, Sigil is a relatively simplified take on the more well-known tabletop games. There are not many calculations to slow turns down during combat. Most numbers like damage of a weapon can be calculated beforehand. With proper notes, turns can get fast.

In addition, there are various rules for exploration, inventory management, crafting, travelling, interactions with NPCs and other similar activities. Such activities have simple rules, and most of the moment-to-moment decision making outside combat is left to common sense and imagination.

Sigil is not ready for full campaigns yet. You are seeing the version *v1-a10* (alpha).

# Where to Start
## Basics
Sigil is a d10-based, combat-focused game with a simple action economy. While [[Combat|combat encounters]] are the primary way of resolving conflicts, there are plenty of nonviolent challenges and opportunities handled by skills.

Each [[Player Characters|player character]] consists of many unique and interesting choices: [[Armor & Weapons#Weapons|weapons]] provide both active and passive abilities, [[Armor & Weapons#Armor|armors]] are strong, [[Player Characters#Techniques|techniques]] carry an impact while not being overpowered, and the two [[Player Characters#Aptitudes|aptitudes]] allow players to fine tune how these abilities scale. Also, there are rarely any limitations: a [[Path of Guides|Guide]] or a [[Path of Sorcerers|Sorcerer]] can wear any type of armor and wield all weapons without penalties.

During their adventures, the party might come across and fight [[Introduction to Monsters|monsters]] such as charming snake-women, tickling sheep-men, elemental spirits as protectors of the nature or owl-vampires. In combat, a player character can use actions granted by their [[Armor & Weapons#Weapons|weapons]], or the [[Common Actions|common actions]] available to every character, to attack their foes. Should regular offence not be sufficient, the characters also have [[Player Characters#Techniques|techniques]] (and class abilities) granted by their [[Player Characters#Classes|Paths]], their main background in life, and [[Player Characters#Classes|Branches]], their secondary expertise. A character's Path also defines their health.

They can also endure the offence of enemies through negating it with their innate [[Player Characters#Resistances|resistances]] or mitigating it through equipment such as [[Armor & Weapons#Armor|armor]] and defensive [[Weapons - Off Hand|off-hand weapons]], or taking it and keeping on fighting with their health pool. Using the right technique at the right time can provide an edge in combat. Just make sure to spare some [[Player Characters#Energy|energy]] if you’re expecting more fighting soon, as techniques require energy which you need to [[Player Characters#Resting and Sleeping|rest]] to replenish properly.

## Reading this website
The bulk of the rules used within combat encounters are in [[Combat|the combat page]]. While it is a good place to dive into the game, you might want to start from [[Player Characters|the character creation page]] for a more gradual introduction. This step can be followed through via [the character creation website](https://sigil-create.tyghsh.cc).

From there, the natural follow-up is the set of pages that explain what a player character is made of:
- The pages under _Character - Paths_,
- The pages under _Character - Branches_,
- The [[Skills|character skills]] page.

Once you have a grasp on those, move on to the basic equipment for every player character: [[Armor & Weapons]].

Next pages to read would be the shared abilities and effects used across the game, in the pages describing [[Common Actions]] and [[Status Effects]].

Finally, if you want to learn about the various items to obtain and monsters you could meet during a campaign, check out the pages under the _Items_ category as well as [[Introduction to Monsters|the monsters page]].
